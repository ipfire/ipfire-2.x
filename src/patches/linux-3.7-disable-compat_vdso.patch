No need to wrap vdso calls as gentoo does not use any version of 
glibc <=2.3.3

COMPAT_VDSO is inappropriate for any modern Hardened Gentoo system. It
conflicts with various parts of PaX, crashing the system if enabled
while PaX's NOEXEC or UDEREF features are active. Moreover, it prevents
a number of important PaX options from appearing in the configuration
menu, including all PaX NOEXEC implementations. Unfortunately, the
reason for the disappearance of these PaX configuration options is
often far from obvious to inexperienced users.

Therefore, we disable the COMPAT_VDSO menu entry entirely. However,
COMPAT_VDSO operation can still be enabled via bootparam and sysctl
interfaces. Consequently, we must also disable the ability to select
COMPAT_VDSO operation at boot or runtime. Here we patch the kernel so
that selecting COMPAT_VDSO operation at boot/runtime has no effect if
conflicting PaX options are enabled, leaving VDSO_ENABLED operation
intact.
