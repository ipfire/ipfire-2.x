+8.14 Slow start in console mode issue
+
+As GUI/GTK Vim works equally well in console mode, many administartors
+deploy those executables system wide.
+Unfortunately, on a remote slow connections GUI/GTK executables behave rather
+slow when user wants to run Vim just in the console mode - because of X environment detection timeout.
+
+Luckily, there is a simple solution for that. Administrators need to deploy
+both GUI/GTK build and just console build executables, like below: >
+
+    |- vim72
+    |----- doc
+    |----- syntax        
+       vimrc    (system rc files)
+       gvimrc
+       gvim.exe (the remaned GUI or GTK built vim.exe)      
+       vim.exe  (the console only executable) 
+
+Define system symbols like below in for ex in LOGIN.COM or SYLOGIN.COM: >
+
+	$ define/nolog VIM RF10:[UTIL.VIM72] ! where you VIM directory is
+	$ vi*m  :== mcr VIM:VIM.EXE
+	$ gvi*m :== mcr VIM:GVIM.EXE
+	$ ! or you can try to spawn with
+	$ gv*im :== spawn/nowait/input=NLA0 mcr VIM:GVIM.EXE -g -GEOMETRY 80x40
+
+
+Like this, users that do not have X environment and want to use Vim just in 
+console mode can avoid performance problems.

+8.15 Common VIM directory - different architectures
+
+In a cluster that contains nodes with different architectures like below:
+
+$show cluster
+View of Cluster from system ID 11655  node: TOR                                                                     18-AUG-2008 11:58:31

++---------------------------------+
+
+It is convinient to have a common VIM directory but execute different
+executables. 
+There are more solutions for this problem:
+
+solution 1. all executables in the same directory with different names
+This is easily done with the following script that can be added
+to the login.com or sylogin.com: >
+
+	$ if f$getsyi("NODE_HWTYPE") .eqs. "VAX"
+	$ then
+	$       say "VAX platform"
+	$       vi*m:== mcr vim:VIM.EXE_VAX

+	$       vi*m :== mcr vim:VIM.EXE_AXP
+	$ endif
+	$ if f$getsyi("ARCH_NAME") .eqs. "IA64"
+	$ then
+	$      say "IA64 platform"
+	$      vi*m :== mcr vim:VIM.EXE_IA64
+	$ endif
+
+solution 2. different directories: >
+
+	$ if f$getsyi("NODE_HWTYPE") .eqs. "VAX"
+	$ then
+	$       say "VAX platform"
+	$       define/nolog VIM RF10:[UTIL.VAX_EXE] ! VAX executables
+	$ endif
+	$ if f$getsyi("NODE_HWTYPE") .eqs. "ALPH"
+	$ then
+	$       say "ALPHA platform"
+	$       define/nolog VIM RF10:[UTIL.AXP_EXE] ! AXP executables
+	$ endif
+	$ if f$getsyi("ARCH_NAME") .eqs. "IA64"
+	$ then
+	$      say "IA64 platform"
+	$      define/nolog VIM RF10:[UTIL.IA64_EXE] ! IA64 executables
+	$ endif
+        $! VIMRUNTIME must be defined in order to find runtime files
+	$ define/nolog VIMRUNTIME RF10:[UTIL.VIM72]

+GETTING BACK TO SOME FILE
+
+If you want to go back to a file that you edited recently, but not when
+exiting Vim, there is a slightly more complicated way.  You can see a list of
+files by typing the command: >
+
+	:oldfiles
+<	1: ~/.viminfo ~
+	2: ~/text/resume.txt ~
+	3: /tmp/draft ~
+
+Now you would like to edit the second file, which is in the list preceded by
+"2:".  You type: >
+
+	:e #<2
+
+Instead of ":e" you can use any command that has a file name argument, the
+"#<2" item works in the same place as "%" (current file name) and "#"
+(alternate file name).  So you can also split the window to edit the third
+file: >
+
+	:split #<3
+
+That #<123 thing is a bit complicated when you just want to edit a file.
+Fortunately there is a simpler way: >
+
+	:browse oldfiles
+<	1: ~/.viminfo ~
+	2: ~/text/resume.txt ~
+	3: /tmp/draft ~
+	-- More --
+
+You get the same list of files as with |:oldfiles|.  If you want to edit
+"resume.txt" first press "q" to stop the listing.  You will get a prompt:
+
+	Type number and <Enter> (empty cancels): ~
+
+Type "2" and press <Enter> to edit the second file.

+More info at |:oldfiles|, |v:oldfiles| and |c_#<|.
