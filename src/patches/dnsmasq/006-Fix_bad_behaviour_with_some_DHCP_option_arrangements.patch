Subject: [PATCH] Fix bad behaviour with some DHCP option arrangements.

The check that there's enough space to store the DHCP agent-id
at the end of the packet could succeed when it should fail
if the END option is in either of the oprion-overload areas.
That could overwrite legit options in the request and cause
bad behaviour. It's highly unlikely that any sane DHCP client
would trigger this bug, and it's never been seen, but this
fixes the problem.

Also fix off-by-one in bounds checking of option processing.
Worst case scenario on that is a read one byte beyond the
end off a buffer with a crafted packet, and maybe therefore
a SIGV crash if the memory after the buffer is not mapped.

Thanks to Timothy Becker for spotting these.
