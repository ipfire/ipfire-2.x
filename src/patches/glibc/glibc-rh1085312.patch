    Return failure in getnetgrent only when all netgroups have been searched (#17363)
    
    The netgroups lookup code fails when one of the groups in the search
    tree is empty.  In such a case it only returns the leaves of the tree
    after the blank netgroup.  This is because the line parser returns a
    NOTFOUND status when the netgroup exists but is empty.  The
    __getnetgrent_internal implementation needs to be fixed to try
    remaining groups if the current group is entry.  This patch implements
    this fix.  Tested on x86_64.
    
    	[BZ #17363]
    	* inet/getnetgrent_r.c (__internal_getnetgrent_r): Try next
    	group if the current group is empty.
