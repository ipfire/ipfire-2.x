    Avoid undefined behaviour in netgroupcache
    
    Using a buffer after it has been reallocated is undefined behaviour,
    so get offsets of the triplets in the old buffer before reallocating
    it.

    Adjust pointers to triplets in netgroup query data (BZ #16474)
    
    The _nss_*_getnetgrent_r query populates the netgroup results in the
    allocated buffer and then sets the result triplet to point to strings
    in the buffer.  This is a problem when the buffer is reallocated since
    the pointers to the triplet strings are no longer valid.  The pointers
    need to be adjusted so that they now point to strings in the
    reallocated buffer.

    Don't use alloca in addgetnetgrentX (BZ #16453)

    addgetnetgrentX has a buffer which is grown as per the needs of the
    requested size either by using alloca or by falling back to malloc if
    the size is larger than 1K.  There are two problems with the alloca
    bits: firstly, it doesn't really extend the buffer since it does not
    use the return value of the extend_alloca macro, which is the location
    of the reallocated buffer.  Due to this the buffer does not actually
    extend itself and hence a subsequent write may overwrite stuff on the
    stack.

    The second problem is more subtle - the buffer growth on the stack is
    discontinuous due to block scope local variables.  Combine that with
    the fact that unlike realloc, extend_alloca does not copy over old
    content and you have a situation where the buffer just has garbage in
    the space where it should have had data.

    This could have been fixed by adding code to copy over old data
    whenever we call extend_alloca, but it seems unnecessarily
    complicated.  This code is not exactly a performance hotspot (it's
    called when there is a cache miss, so factors like network lookup or
    file reads will dominate over memory allocation/reallocation), so this
    premature optimization is unnecessary.
    
    Thanks Brad Hubbard <bhubbard@redhat.com> for his help with debugging
    the problem.
