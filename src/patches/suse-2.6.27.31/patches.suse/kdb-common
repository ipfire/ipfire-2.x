+How the KDB backtrace for x86 works, how to diagnose problems and submit a bug
+==============================================================================
+
+Unlike ia64, x86 architectures do not mandate unwind information in the kernel.
+gcc will include some unwind information for C functions, but not for assembler
+code.  Attempts have been made to add unwind information to the assembler code
+by hand, with little success.  Eventually Linus rejected the x86 unwind code
+because it was breaking too often and destroying useful debugging data.
+
+Even if the x86 unwinder worked correctly, it would only give an accurate
+backtrace, it would not give function arguments. Needless to say, function
+arguments are what people really want.  To get function arguments requires much
+more support from the compiler than simple unwind data, the compiler has to
+track line by line where each argument is held and make that data available to
+the debugger.  Compiling with gcc -g will provide that information, but the
+resulting kernel is several times larger than normal.
+
+Although the gcc -g data can be stored on another machine, there are constructs
+in the kernel that cannot be tracked by this method.  i386 builds with 4K stacks
+and all x86_64 builds have multiple kernel stacks.  The compiler knows nothing
+about these extra stacks and cannot backtrace through them correctly.  The
+assembler code in arch/{i386,x86_64}/kernel/entry.S is a maze of twisty logic
+paths, some of which eventually jump to common labels.  Describing this twisty
+logic to an unwinder is very difficult, expecially when you try to describe
+where arguments and/or registers are held).
+
+KDB gets an accurate x86 backtrace and extracts the arguments by performing code
+decomposition and analysis at run time.  This avoids the need to bloat the
+running kernel to several times its normal size with gcc -g data.  KDB (unlike
+gdb) also knows about the additional kernel stacks and twisty assembler code
+paths.
+
+The x86 backtrace code for i386 is very similar to the x86_64 code, with 80%
+common code and data.  Most of the differences between the backtrace for the two
+architectures is due to the assembler code and stack handling.  To avoid code
+duplication between KDB patches, the x86 backtrace code is actually stored in
+the kdb common patch, in source kdb/kdba_bt_x86.c.  kdb/Makefile only builds
+kdba_bt_x86.o for i386 or x86_64.  Most of the code reads as if the architecture
+is x86_64, using register names like rsp and rip.  i386 is treated as a subset
+of x86_64, with fewer registers and printing the names as esp and eip.  When
+this documentation refers to rsp and rip, read it as esp and eip for i386.  The
+20% of code and data that is different in held in two large #ifdef sections,
+scan kdba_bt_x86.c for CONFIG_X86_64.  Be careful when changing anything in the
+architecture specific sections, you will need to review the other architecture
+to see if it needs changes as well.
+
+The idea behind the x86 backtrace is to trace one function at a time, which
+gives us the calling function.  Then apply the same algorithm to the calling
+function until you unwind to the first function in the process.  The starting
+point for tracing any process is to extract the current stack pointer and
+current instruction pointer (rsp and rip).  The way that these values are
+extracted varies between running tasks and blocked tasks, the method is
+described later (Process Starting Point) but ignore it for now, just assume that
+we have a starting rsp and rip.
+
+Given the instruction pointer (rip), we identify the start and end of the kernel
+or module function it is in, using the kernel symbol table.  This is easy for C
+code, it is significantly harder for assembler code because of the twisty code
+paths that branch to common labels.  The method of identifying the current
+function is described later (Identifying The Current Function) but ignore it for
+now, just assumes that we have the start and end address of the function plus
+its name.
+
+After the rip has been mapped to a function name with sensible start and end
+addresses, the next step is to analyse the code paths in that function.  KDB
+already has a built in disassembler (copied with slight modifications from
+binutils) which knows how to decode each x86 instruction.  Instead of
+duplicating that logic in kdba_bt_x86, it takes advantage of the fact that you
+can override the disassembler's print function, sending the output line to a
+buffer instead of printing it.  kdba_bt_x86 stills has to decode the buffer but
+that is a lot easier than decoding the x86 instruction set.
+
+The code analysis consists of two main passes.  There are example below of the
+analysis with basic block (bb) debugging activated (Examples of Basic Block
+Debugging Output).
+
+The first pass (bb_pass1) identifies all the basic blocks in the function.  For
+our purposes, a basic block has a single entry point and one or more exit
+points.  The start of the function is the start of basic block 0, all other
+blocks are the target of jump instructions (conditional or unconditional) from
+within the rest of the code.  A block ends with an unconditional jump or with a
+terminating instruction such as ret, iret, sysexit, sysret or ud2a (BUG).  A
+block can also end because the next instruction is the start of a new block
+(target of jmp or jcc), in this case there is an implied drop through from one
+block to the next.
+
+Although a call instruction also transfers control, it returns to the next
+instruction so call is not treated as a transfer.  Instead call is treated as a
+normal instruction with side effects, the scratch registers are cleared after a
+call.
+
+At the end of the first pass over the function we have a directed graph that
+starts at bb[0].  The nodes of the graph (bb_list[]) are the basic blocks with
+their start and end address.  The vertices are the jmp or jcc instructions
+(bb_jmp_list[]) that transfer control between blocks, plus any implied drop
+through transfers between consecutive blocks.  This graph can have cycles, many
+functions have loops in them which transfer control back to earlier in the code
+body.
+
+The second pass (bb_pass2) runs over the directed graph analysing the effect of
+each instruction on the register and memory state.  It is important to
+understand that the analysis in this pass is an abstract one, it does not use
+actual hex values for the register contents, instead it uses symbolic values.
+When the basic block code says that "register rsi contains value rax" it means
+that whatever value was in rax on entry to the function has also been copied to
+register rsi at this point in the logic flow.
+
+At an abstract level, all C functions start with exactly the same state, each
+register contains its own symbolic value (except for the stack pointer, see
+later) with no local stack variables defined yet.  Assembler functions tend to
+have unusual starting points, with some registers and/or memory contents defined
+differently on entry.  For example, ret_from_intr on i386 already has a struct
+pt_regs on its stack, ret_from_intr on x86_64 already has a partial struct
+pt_regs plus another two words stacked on top of it.  The special starting cases
+are listed in the arch specific bb_special_cases[].
+
+Once the input state of bb[0] has been defined (including any special cases),
+bb_pass2_do_changed_blocks() runs over all the nodes in bb_list[].  Each
+instruction in each block is analysed (Tracking the Effects of Instructions) to
+see what effect it has on the abstract register state, the analysis of each
+instruction is done in bb_usage().  An instruction can copy one register to
+another, it can copy a register to stack, move from stack to a register or it
+can invalidate the contents of a register or memory location.  A general rule in
+bb_usage() is that any operation whose results cannot be calculated in terms of
+an original input value gives an undefined result.  Remember that it is the
+abstract value that becomes undefined, moving a constant to a register gives a
+defined value for the view of the program but it is undefined as far as the
+abstract state is concerned.
+
+References to data on the stack are a little awkward because the stack pointer
+frequently changes.  To overcome this, kdba_bt_x86 defines a pseudo register
+called the 'original stack pointer' (osp).  This always represents the stack
+pointer on entry to the function, so on entry rsp contains osp+0x0.  As rsp is
+modified, it still points at osp, but its offset from osp changes.  Copying rsp
+to another register (e.g. mov %rsp,%rbp) copies the osp offset as well.  At the
+point that this function calls the next function down the stack, kdba_bt_x86
+knows the delta from osp to rsp.  Applying that delta to the actual value of the
+stack pointer gives the stack pointer value on input to the current function,
+that location contains the return address so we can go up one stack frame and
+repeat the process.
+
+After doing basic block analysis on the current function, kdba_bt_x86 knows what
+the abstract register and memory state is at the point this function was
+interrupted or it called the next function down the stack, this is the exit
+state.  For an interrupt the actual register values are saved in a struct
+pt_regs, for a call we have unwound from the KDB interrupt back to the called
+function so we have some idea of what the register values are in the called
+function.  The abstract exit state is merged with the known actual register
+values to derive the original stack pointer.  That in turn gives us any
+registers that were saved on stack.  The original stack pointer gives the return
+address from the calling function, go up one stack frame and repeat the
+analysis.
+
+
+Process Starting Point
+======================
+
+All backtrace code needs a starting point which defines at least the stack
+pointer and instruction pointer, it may define other registers as well.  The
+first part of kdba_bt_stack() extracts the starting point.  Processes can be in
+one of three states, running (currently on a cpu), blocked (sleeping or ready to
+run but not currently on a cpu) or unknown.
+
+For running processes, the current rsp and rip are dynamic.  Because KDB stops
+the entire machine by sending an interrupt to the other cpus, KDB can save the
+rsp and rip for each cpu at the point where KDB is entered.  This data is held
+in array kdb_running_process and is stored by kdb_save_running() and the arch
+specific kdba_save_running() functions.  When backtracing a running process, KDB
+uses the data in kdb_running_process as its starting point.
+
+For blocked processes we always have the saved rsp, it is held in the process's
+thread_info.  For i386 blocked processes, thread_info also contains the saved
+rip.  For x86_64 blocked processes, rip is no longer saved in thread_info, it is
+assumed that all blocked processes will resume at assembler label thread_return,
+so that rip is used on x86_64.  See arch specific kdba_bt_stack_rip().
+
+Unknown process state only occurs when the user does 'bt <stack_address>'.
+Unlike other bt commands, 'bt <stack_address>' does not identify any specific
+process, instead it identifies a kernel stack.  <stack_address> must be inside a
+valid kernel stack and must point to a saved rip from a call instruction.
+kdba_bt_x86.c uses the common kdba_get_stack_info() and arch specific
+kdba_get_stack_info_alternate() functions to check that the address falls within
+a valid kernel stack.  If the user gives a stack address that does not point to
+a saved rip from a call instruction then the backtrace will be garbage.
+
+
+Identifying The Current Function
+================================
+
+Given a rip value, KDB uses the kallsyms data to find the start of the function
+(first address <= rip) and the end of the function (next symbol in kallsyms).
+This works for plain C code because gcc only generates one label per function.
+It does not work for assembler code or for assembler code embedded in C
+functions, because the assembler labels appear as global entries in kallsyms.
+For example, arch/i386/kernel/entry.S has function ret_from_exception which
+contains three global labels ret_from_intr, check_userspace and
+resume_userspace.  If rip points to any of those global labels, KDB wants the
+start of the real function, i.e. ret_from_exception.  In addition, if rip points
+to ret_from_exception, KDB wants the end of the function to be after the last
+global label in that function, i.e. after resume_userspace.
+
+The simplest way to handle these unwanted global labels is to list the spurious
+assembler labels, which is done in the arch specific array bb_spurious.  After
+mapping rip to the nearest start and end labels from kallsyms, kdb_bb() works
+backwards until it finds a non-spurious label then works forwards to the next
+non-spurious label.  That gives a real start and end address and a real name for
+the current function.
+
+Note that this algorithm only applies in kdb_bb() when it maps rip to a suitable
+start and end address.  When disassembling the code, you will still see the
+spurious label names, users need to see the extra labels.  ret_from_exception on
+i386 disassembles like this (2.6.22) :-
+
+[0]kdb> id ret_from_exception
+0xc0102554 ret_from_exception:         cli
+0xc0102555 ret_from_intr:         mov    $0xfffff000,%ebp
+0xc010255a ret_from_intr+0x5:     and    %esp,%ebp
+0xc010255c check_userspace:         mov    0x34(%esp),%eax
+0xc0102560 check_userspace+0x4:     mov    0x30(%esp),%al
+0xc0102564 check_userspace+0x8:     and    $0x20003,%eax
+0xc0102569 check_userspace+0xd:     cmp    $0x3,%eax
+0xc010256c check_userspace+0x10:    jb     0xc010258c resume_kernel
+0xc0102572 check_userspace+0x16:    mov    %esi,%esi
+0xc0102574 resume_userspace:         cli
+0xc0102575 resume_userspace+0x1:     mov    0x8(%ebp),%ecx
+0xc0102578 resume_userspace+0x4:     and    $0xfe3e,%ecx
+0xc010257e resume_userspace+0xa:     jne    0xc01026f4 work_pending
+0xc0102584 resume_userspace+0x10:    jmp    0xc01026a7 restore_all
+0xc0102589 resume_userspace+0x15:    lea    0x0(%esi),%esi
+0xc010258c resume_kernel:         cli
+
+For the purposes of kdba_bt_x86.c, any rip from 0xc0102554 to 0xc0102589 needs
+to map to the range 0xc0102554 (start) to 0xc010258c (end) with function name
+ret_from_exception.  Therefore ret_from_intr, check_userspace and
+resume_userspace are listed in bb_spurious[] for i386 so those symbols are
+ignored.  The comments in bb_spurious[] list the function that encloses each
+spurious label, those comments are only for humans, they do not affect the code.
+
+Once rip has been mapped to non-spurious labels, the module name, function name,
+start and end address are stored in variables bb_mod_name, bb_func_name,
+bb_func_start, bb_func_end.  These variables are used throughout kdba_bt_x86.c
+for processing each function in turn.
+
+Watch for changes to assembler code, especially in arch/i386/kernel/entry.S,
+arch/x86_64/kernel/entry.S and arch/x86_64/ia32/ia32entry.S.  When new labels
+are added you may need to adjust bb_spurious[] for that architecture.  Running
+bb_all can help identify assembler labels that have been added or deleted.
+
+
+Tracking the Effects of Instructions
+====================================
+
+bb_pass2_do_changed_blocks() uses the KDB disassembler to decode the x86
+instructions to something a human can read.  bb_dis_pass2() is used as a print
+routine to store data for a single instruction in a buffer then
+bb_parse_buffer() starts the analysis.  Any instruction prefixes like lock or
+rep are stripped out.  The opcode string is isolated then up to 3 operands are
+extracted (imul can have 3 operands), these are src, dst and dst2.  The operand
+is matched against table bb_opcode_usage_all[] which lists all the instructions
+that actually appear in i386 and x86_64 kernels.  A lot of the x86 instrcution
+set is not used by the kernel so instructions such as SSE do not appear in
+bb_opcode_usage_all[].
+
+Each operand is decoded by bb_parse_operand() to see whether it has a segment
+prefix, displacement, base, index or scale.  An indirect call or jmp is
+identified.  Operands consisting only of a register are classified as 'reg'
+type, displacements starting with '$' are immediate values otherwise the operand
+refers to a memory location.  Any base or index register name is mapped to the
+abstract register name that contains it, this takes care of mapping (say) %ah to
+rax.
+
+After decoding the opcode and all its operands, bb_usage() decides what effect
+the instruction will have on the abstract state machine.  Some x86 instructions
+list all the affected registers in their operands and these can be handled as
+generic cases.  Alas many x86 instructions have side effects and change
+registers that are not listed in the operands, these have to be handled as
+special cases.  enum bb_operand_usage lists the generic and special cases.
+
+bb_usage() is basically one huge switch statement over the special values in
+enum bb_operand_usage.  For each special case it tracks the side effects of the
+instruction.  Once all the special cases have been handled and converted to
+generic cases then bb_usage() handles the generic cases.
+
+bb_usage() detects when a register is copied to another register, a register is
+copied to stack or a known stack value is copied to a register and updates the
+state data accordingly.  It is particularly important that all stack pointer
+updates and copies of the stack pointer are tracked, much of the saved state is
+on stack and can be accessed via any register that points to the stack, not just
+via rsp.
+
+i386 built with 4K stacks and all x86_64 builds have multiple kernel stacks.
+bb_usage() knows which instructions or locations are used to switch stacks and
+pretends that these instructions have no effect on the contents of rsp.  The
+higher level backtrace code knows how to handle stack switching, it is too
+complicated for basic block analysis.
+
+
+Transfer of Control Outside the Current Function
+================================================
+
+Ignoring call instructions, most C code does not transfer control outside the
+current function, IOW there are no jump instructions to instructions outside the
+function.  There are a few cases that this can occur for C code, inline
+assembler and tail recursion.
+
+Tail recursion occurs when a function ends by returning the value from a second
+function and that second function has exactly the same arguments and return
+value as the current function.  For example,
+
+    int bar(int i, char *p)
+    {
+        ... do some work and return an int ...
+    }
+
+    int foo(int i, char *p)
+    {
+        return bar(i, p);
+    }
+
+If tail recursion is active (gcc -foptimize-sibling-calls) then instead of foo
+calling bar, bar returning to foo then foo returning to its caller, gcc will end
+foo with a direct jmp to bar.  The source code says that something called foo
+but the stack trace will show bar is active, with no sign of foo on stack.  When
+bar returns it will use the return address from the code that called foo.
+
+bb_transfer() detects an unconditional jmp to code outside the function body and
+assumes that this represents tail recursion.  For tail recursion to work
+correctly, all the preserved registers must contain their original values,
+bb_sanity_check() validates this.  Any deviation from the expected state will
+stop basic block analysis and fall back on the old unreliable backtrace code.
+
+Besides tail recursion in C code, assembler code can jump to labels outside the
+current function.  Unfortunately this occurs all the time in the twisty
+assembler code and, to make things worse, many of these transfers are done with
+non-standard register or memory state.  bb_special_case() and the arch specific
+bb_special_cases[] handle all the known special cases, including what the
+register and/or memory state should be.  Any deviation from the expected state
+will stop basic block analysis and fall back on the old unreliable backtrace
+code.
+
+
+Locating Arguments
+==================
+
+Function arguments can be passed in registers or on stack.  The full ABI for
+passing arguments is described in
+
+  http://www.caldera.com/developers/devspecs/abi386-4.pdf
+  http://www.x86-64.org/documentation/abi.pdf
+
+The short description, ignoring special cases like passing structures by name
+and floating point arguments which tend not to apply to the kernel, is :-
+
+i386.   With -mpregparm=0, all arguments are passed on stack, except for
+        functions defined as FASTCALL, where the first 3 arguments are passed in
+        registers.
+
+        With -mregparm=3, the first 3 arguments are passed in registers except
+        for functions defined as asmlinkage or with variable number of
+        arguments, when arguments are still passed on stack.  -mpregparm=3 used
+        to be a config option, in recent kernels it is the default.
+
+        Arguments defined as long long (64 bit) are passed in two registers or
+        in two locations on stack.  Being passed in two pieces makes a 64 bit
+        argument look like two 32 bit arguments to KDB, it will be printed as
+        two separate arguments.
+
+        When compiled with -mregparm=3, if a 64 bit argument is argument number
+        2 then it will not be split between register and stack, instead it will
+        all be on stack and the third argument register will not be used.  This
+        makes it look like there is an extra argument in the list.  There is
+        nothing that KDB can do to detect these corner cases with 64 bit
+        arguments on i386, which is a pity because they can confuse users.
+
+        The preserved registers are ebx, ebp, esp, esi, edi.  Arguments are
+        passed in eax, edx, ecx.  The return value is in eax.
+
+x86_64. The first 6 arguments are passed in registers, the 7th and later
+        arguments are passed on stack.  Except for functions with a variable
+        number of arguments (e.g. printk) where all arguments are on stack
+        except for rax which contains the number of SSE arguments (always 0 for
+        the kernel).
+
+        The preserved registers are rbx, rbp, rsp, r12, r13, r14, r15.
+        Arguments are passed in rdi, rsi, rdx, rcx, r8, r9.  The return value is
+        in rax.
+
+For both architectures, kdba_bt detects an argument that is passed in a register
+by the fact that the function code reads from that argument type register while
+it contains its original value.  IOW, testing the value of rax, copying rax to
+another register or storing it on stack without first overwriting rax means that
+rax contains a useful input value.  Reading from memory which is above the
+original stack pointer means that there is a argument at that location on
+stack.
+
+There are some functions in the kernel whose definition contains arguments that
+are not actually used.  Typically these functions are instantiations of generic
+function definitions where some, but not all, instantiations use all the
+arguments.  For example, a filesystem function may take flags that are not used
+by this particular filesystem, but the function definition has to match the
+generic filesystem declarations.  If the unused arguments are at the end of the
+list then there is no way of telling from the object code that they exist, the
+function that does not use the trailing aguments will have no code that refers
+to them.  KDB will print a truncated argument list for this case.
+
+If the unused arguments are not at the end of the list then KDB can detect the
+presence of the unused arguments, because there is code that refers to later
+arguments.  KDB will print the unused argument, although gcc may have
+overwritten the register it is in, in which case KDB prints "invalid".
+
+Originally kdba_bt_x86 would detect that there was no reference to arguments in
+registers but there were still references to arguments on stack and assume that
+the function had all its arguments on stack.  Unfortunately this did not work
+with the large number of 'pass through' functions in the kernel.  A 'pass
+through' function is one which calls another function with roughly the same
+argument list and makes no other reference to the register arguments.  For
+example, ipv4_doint_and_flush_strategy() takes 7 arguments, calls
+devinet_conf_sysctl() with those 7 arguments in the same order and has no other
+reference to any of its arguments.
+
+Pass through functions do not touch the arguments that are passed in registers
+because they are already in the right location for the routine about to be
+called, so the pass through function has no code that references the argument
+registers.  No code means that kdba_bt_x86 cannot tell if the function has
+register arguments or not.  The arguments passed on stack must always be copied
+to the new stack frame, even for pass through functions, so the arguments on
+stack can always be detected.
+
+kdba_bt_x86 was changed to assume that if there are any arguments on stack then
+there are always arguments in registers, except for a list of functions that are
+known to be asmlinkage or to have a variable number of arguments.
+bb_assume_pass_through() ignores the known special cases, for other functions
+which have stack arguments but no register arguments it assumes the function is
+pass through and prints a warning about that assumption.
+
+The above heuristics mean that there is one case that kdba_bt_x86 cannot detect:
+pass through functions where all the arguments are in registers.  These have no
+argument references at all in their code, so they are printed with no arguments.
+All they do is call another function so this class of functions never fails, or
+if it does fail then it is due to something that is not argument related.  If
+the failure is further down the call stack then the arguments are printed at the
+next function down the stack, so the user still has the arguments.
+
+This list of limitations on getting the x86 arguments may seem to be a long one,
+but kdba_bt_x86 gives sensible results for most functions.  For kernel
+debugging, any arguments are far better than none at all.
+
+
+Kernel Stack Switching
+======================
+
+Understanding the unusual way that x86 kernel stacks are used is very important
+when diagnosing backtrace problems.  Every process has its own normal kernel
+stack, even processes that run entirely within the kernel such as kthread or the
+per cpu migration processes.  The normal stacks are 4K or 8K on i386 (depending
+on CONFIG_4KSTACKS) and 8K on x86_64.  The normal stacks are global, they are
+not tied to any cpu.
+
+For i386 with 8K stacks there are no other kernel stacks so there is no stack
+switching to worry about.
+
+For i386 with 4K process stacks, each cpu also has a 4K soft irq stack and a 4K
+hard irq stack.  It is possible for a process to be running on its own process
+stack, for the process to be interrupted by a soft irq which is then interrupted
+by a hard irq.  At that point the backtrace is split between the hard irq, the
+soft irq and the normal normal stacks.
+
+On x86_64, each cpu always has stacks for stackfault, doublefault, nmi, debug,
+mce and interrupts.  See Documentation/x86_64/kernel-stacks.
+
+The arch specific kdba_get_stack_info_alternate() function works out which stack
+the backtrace starts on, how big the stack is and how to switch to the next
+stack.  This information is stored in the kdb_activation_record and used by the
+higher level backtrace code to detect a stack switch.
+
+The normal stack has some padding at the end, this reflects the stack pointer
+when the process was created in the kernel.  kdba_bt_x86 cannot backtrace
+through this padding data, mainly because the code that set the nitial stack
+pointer no longer exists after boot.  ARCH_NORMAL_PADDING defines how many words
+to ignore at the end of the normal stack.
+
+
+Debugging KDB
+=============
+
+KDB has conditional debugging print statements scattered throughout the code.
+If KDB is not behaving as expected, you can turn on debugging and rerun the
+command.  Before debugging KDB, set LINES 10000 and capture the output via a
+serial console.  If using minicom, turn on word wrap (control-A W) and capture
+mode (control-A L).  If you are using a serial console via a serial to Ethernet
+interface using ssh or telnet, use the 'script' command to start the session.
+
+The various KDB_DEBUG_FLAG_* flags are listed in include/linux/kdbprivate.h.
+You set debug with 'set KDBDEBUG 0xnn' where nn is the or'd value of the desired
+flags.  'set KDBDEBUG 0' turns off KDB debugging.  When diagnosing x86 backtrace
+problems, the most useful debug flags are
+
+  KDB_DEBUG_FLAG_ARA            0x10    Activation record, arch specific
+  KDB_DEBUG_FLAG_BB_SUMM        0x04    Basic block analysis, summary only
+  KDB_DEBUG_FLAG_BB             0x20    All basic block analysis
+
+ARA prints information about the different kernel stacks as kdba_bt_x86 unwinds
+through the switched kernel stacks.  BB_SUMM prints a summary of the basic block
+analysis for each function, including the abstract exit state and the rollback
+calculations.  BB prints a huge amount of basic block debugging, you probably
+only want to turn this for the full backtrace on as a last resort.
+
+I find 'set KDBDEBUG 0x14' to be best to get an overview of a problem.  It gives
+both the kernel stack information plus the abstract state and actual location of
+data for each function.
+
+Command 'bb1' does a detailed debug session for a single function, bb1 takes a
+single parameter, the address of the exit point from the function, by number,
+not by name.  bb1 turns on KDB_DEBUG_FLAG_BB, does basic block analysis for the
+function that contains the exit point then resets the debug flags to their
+previous value.
+
+Command 'bb_all' runs through every function in the base kernel (not module
+functions) and does a basic block analysis of every function.  It also validates
+the various tables in kdba_bt_x86 where possible.  bb_all is meant for the KDB
+maintainer to check that all the base kernel function pass the sanity checks, it
+can also be used by end users when reporting a bug.  bb_all takes no parameters.
+It prints a '.' for every 100 functions it has analysed and allows for up to 20
+errors before giving up.  The output from bb_all also includes the config
+variables that affect basic block analysis plus any assumptions about 'pass
+through' functions.
+
+
+Submitting a Bug Report Against kdba_bt_x86
+===========================================
+
+Capture the KDB output via a serial console.
+
+set LINES 10000
+set BTSP 1
+set KDBDEBUG 0x14
+Reproduce the problem.
+set KDBDEBUG 0
+bb_all
+
+If you can identify the rip/eip where kdba_bt_x86 gets confused, run bb1 with
+that address.
+
+Find each set of output from kdba_get_stack_info in the trace, extract the last
+two lines and type those lines into KDB.  That will give a hex and symbolic dump
+of the raw kernel stacks.  For example, if the trace data is
+
+kdba_get_stack_info: esp=0xc04fbef8 cpu=0 task=c047b3e0
+kdba_get_stack_info: ar->stack
+    physical_start=0xc04fb000
+    physical_end=0xc04fc000
+    logical_start=0xc04fb038
+    logical_end=0xc04fc000
+    next=0xc04b4f44
+    id=hardirq_ctx
+    set MDCOUNT 1024
+    mds 0xc04fb000
+
+then type the last two lines into KDB.  Repeat this for each stack listed by
+kdba_get_stack_info on the failing backtrace.
+
+Send all the console output to the KDB maintainer.
+
+
+Examples of Basic Block Debugging Output
+========================================

+Example of the basic block analysis of fs/namei::getname() on i386.  Kernel
+2.6.22, i386, compiled with frame pointers, gcc 4.1.0.

+Basic block debugging is very verbose, so set a high number of output lines.
+You really need a reliable serial console to capture this amount of output.

+IOW the return address that is stored on stack due to a call from this function
+to the next function down the call stack.  Assume that getname() has called
+kmem_cache_free() and something went wrong in kmem_cache_free() or one of the
+functions that it calls.  The call to kmem_cache_free is at 0xc015cd68 and the

+
+After analysing the logic flow, we can see that getname() consists of 8 basic
+blocks (nodes in bb_list[]).  5 of these blocks end in unconditional jumps, the
+other 3 drop through to the next block.  There are 15 transfers of control
+(vertices in bb_jmp_list[]).  12 of these transfers are explicit jmp or jcc
+instructions, the other 3 are implicit transfers when dropping through from one
+block to the next.  The node list is sorted by start address, the vertex list is
+not sorted.
+
+Basic block 0 starts at the function start (0xc015cce8) and ends at 0xc015cd38.
+0xc015cd39 is the target of a jump instruction (0xc015cd1b: je 0xc015cd39) so
+0xc015cd39 starts a new block, which means that 0xc015cd38 becomes the end of
+the previous block.  Because bb[0] does not end in an explicit jmp instruction,
+there is a drop through from the end of bb[0] to the start of bb[1], see
+bb_jmp[12].
+
+    bb_pass2: start
+
+To get the most accurate results from pass2, try to scan the directed graph by
+only looking at nodes whose inputs are all defined.  Initially only process
+nodes with no missing inputs.

+decoded.  Although this is i386 (ebp), it is reported as rbp.  Using the x86_64
+names for registers throughout makes it easier to create common code for the two

+
+      rsp osp offset +0x0 -> -0x4
+
+A push instruction decrements rsp by 4 (i386) or 8 (x86_64) bytes.  rsp
+originally contained the original stack pointer (osp), now it contains the
+original stack pointer - 4.
+
+      *(rsp+0x0 osp-0x4) = rbp slot 0
+
+The stack location pointed to by *rsp now contains the original value of rbp.
+Since rsp contains (osp-0x4), *(osp-0x4) contains rbp.  It is slot 0 in the
+memory array associated with the register state.

+
+Push 3 registers to stack.  rsp is adjusted for each push and stack locations
+are assigned to contain the values of edi, esi and ebx.  This sequence is very
+common in i386 C functions.  edi, esi and ebx are preserved registers on i386,

+      rdi = rax (rax)
+
+Having saved edi on stack, gcc now overwrites edi with eax.  At this point rax
+still contains its original value, so rdi now contains a copy of rax, as well as
+the original value which is still in rax.  This is a common sequence in C code.
+rax contains argument 0 but it is also a scratch register.  If the code needs to
+use argument 0 later then its value must be saved somewhere before executing any
+instruction that changes rax.  edi is a preserved register so its contents will
+not be changed by any function that we call, or if it is changed then it will be
+restored before returning to this function.
+
+rax is listed in the arch specific bb_param_reg[] list and the code is reading
+from rax while it still contains its original value.  The only way that makes
+any sense is when rax is an input argument to getname().  We note that fact in
+bb_reg_read().

+Basic block debugging prints the register and memory state when transfering

+This instruction is a bit misleading.  It looks like gcc is restoring a value
+from the stack *(osp-0x14) to edx, but we have no record of any useful data
+being stored at osp-0x14.  In fact gcc is just reducing the stack pointer by 4
+bytes to reverse the effect of 0xc015ccee: sub $0x4,%esp, the value popped into
+edx contains nothing useful.  Why gcc does pop instead of add $0x4,%esp is a
+puzzle, probably some micro optimization.

+
+This pop is doing something useful.  It is restoring the original value of the
+preserved register ebx from stack, reversing 0xc015cced: push %ebx.  Note that
+incrementing rsp from osp-0x10 to osp-0xc invalidates the data held in memory at
+osp-0x10, so we delete our record of it.

+
+We identified one argument passed in a register (the read of rax at 0xc015ccf1)
+and no reference to memory locations above the stack frame.  So we have one
+argument being passed in a register and no arguments being passed on stack.

+
+We told bb1 that the exit address from this function is 0xc015cd6d.  The
+abstract state at this exit point was saved, it defines how we rollback the
+actual register values from the next function down the stack (kmem_cache_free)
+to get the actual register values on entry to this function (getname).  See
+bb_actual_rollback() which updates bb_actual[].
+
+Looking at the exit state above, we see that rsp contains the abstracte value
+osp-0x14.  It is a given that we have the actual value of rsp after the call
+from getname() to kmem_cache_free(), otherwise we would not have found the
+return address on stack and we would not be analysing getname().  Adding 0x14
+(the delta from osp to rsp) to our current actual rsp gives us the actual value
+of osp on entry to getname().
+
+The main aim of doing all this work is to track the function arguments so we can
+print them if possible.  getname() only has one argument which was passed in
+eax.  According to the abstract exit state, the original value of rax is
+currently in rdi, so by looking at the actual value of rdi from the next stack
+frame down we are able to get the argument to getname().
+
+It is not always possible to get register arguments, gcc will only preserve
+input arguments as long as it needs them so there may be no saved copy of
+arguments that are passed in register.  In this case, bt_print_one() prints
+"invalid".
+
+If basic block analysis detected any arguments were passed on stack, their
+contents can now be extracted based on the known value of the stack pointer.
+bt_print_one() prints the arguments, if BT_ARGS is non-zero then any argument
+that might be a kernel address is printed as a symbol.
+
+Once rsp has been rolled back to osp, we can calculate that actual address of
+the stack locations that contain useful data.  The previous values of rbp, rdi,
+rsi and rbx are then copied from those locations into bb_actual[].  That gives
+the values for those registers at the exit point from the function that called
+getname().  Go up one level and repeat the analysis.
+
+There are two references to rdi in the exit state, which can be confusing.
+
+        rdi = rax
+        slot 1 offset_address -0x8 rdi
+
+The first reference says that "register rdi contains the original value of rax",
+the second reference says that "*(osp-0x8) contains the original value of rdi".
+Do not confuse the two, one is by name, the other is by value.
+
+getname() is a fairly simple function, it has no loops.  __follow_mount is more
+complicated, it has loops as well as BUG() statements.

+bb[1] is being rescanned because the input from bb[6] has changed, however the
+rescan of bb[1] reports 'no state change', the changed input from bb[6] did not
+affect the final output state from bb[1].  Because the output state from bb[1]
+has not changed since the previous scan, there is no need to rescan bb[2], bb[7]

+.SH NAME
+Built-in Kernel Debugger for Linux - v4.4
+.SH "Overview"
+This document describes the built-in kernel debugger available
+for linux.   This debugger allows the programmer to interactively
+examine kernel memory, disassemble kernel functions, set breakpoints
+in the kernel code and display and modify register contents.
+.P
+A symbol table is included in the kernel image and in modules which
+enables all non-stack symbols (including static symbols) to be used as
+arguments to the kernel debugger commands.
+.SH "Getting Started"
+To include the kernel debugger in a linux kernel, use a
+configuration mechanism (e.g. xconfig, menuconfig, et. al.)
+to enable the \fBCONFIG_KDB\fP option.   Additionally, for accurate
+stack tracebacks, it is recommended that the \fBCONFIG_FRAME_POINTER\fP
+option be enabled (if present).   \fBCONFIG_FRAME_POINTER\fP changes the compiler
+flags so that the frame pointer register will be used as a frame
+pointer rather than a general purpose register.
+.P
+After linux has been configured to include the kernel debugger,
+make a new kernel with the new configuration file (a make clean
+is recommended before making the kernel), and install the kernel
+as normal.
+.P
+You can compile a kernel with kdb support but have kdb off by default,
+select \fBCONFIG_KDB_OFF\fR.  Then the user has to explicitly activate
+kdb by booting with the 'kdb=on' flag or, after /proc is mounted, by
+.nf
+  echo "1" > /proc/sys/kernel/kdb
+.fi
+You can also do the reverse, compile a kernel with kdb on and
+deactivate kdb with the boot flag 'kdb=off' or, after /proc is mounted,
+by
+.nf
+  echo "0" > /proc/sys/kernel/kdb
+.fi
+.P
+When booting the new kernel, the 'kdb=early' flag
+may be added after the image name on the boot line to
+force the kernel to stop in the kernel debugger early in the
+kernel initialization process.  'kdb=early' implies 'kdb=on'.
+If the 'kdb=early' flag isn't provided, then kdb will automatically be
+invoked upon system panic or when the \fBPAUSE\fP key is used from the
+keyboard, assuming that kdb is on.  Older versions of kdb used just a
+boot flag of 'kdb' to activate kdb early, this is no longer supported.
+.P
+KDB can also be used via the serial port.  Set up the system to
+have a serial console (see \fIDocumentation/serial-console.txt\fP), you
+must also have a user space program such as agetty set up to read from
+the serial console.
+The control sequence \fB<esc>KDB\fP on the serial port will cause the
+kernel debugger to be entered, assuming that kdb is on, that some
+program is reading from the serial console, at least one cpu is
+accepting interrupts and the serial console driver is still usable.
+.P
+\fBNote:\fR\ When the serial console sequence consists of multiple
+characters such as <esc>KDB then all but the last character are passed
+through to the application that is reading from the serial console.
+After exiting from kdb, you should use backspace to delete the rest of
+the control sequence.
+.P
+You can boot with kdb activated but without the ability to enter kdb
+via any keyboard sequence.
+In this mode, kdb will only be entered after a system failure.
+Booting with kdb=on-nokey will activate kdb but ignore keyboard
+sequences that would normally drop you into kdb.
+kdb=on-nokey is mainly useful when you are using a PC keyboard and your
+application needs to use the Pause key.
+You can also activate this mode by
+.nf
+  echo "2" > /proc/sys/kernel/kdb
+.fi
+.P
+If the console is sitting on the login prompt when you enter kdb, then
+the login command may switch into upper case mode.
+This is not a kdb bug, it is a "feature" of login - if the userid is
+all upper case then login assumes that you using a TeleType (circa
+1960) which does not have lower case characters.
+Wait 60 seconds for login to timeout and it will switch back to lower
+case mode.
+.P
+\fBNote:\fR\ Your distributor may have chosen a different kdb
+activation sequence for the serial console.
+Consult your distribution documentation.
+.P
+If you have both a keyboard+video and a serial console, you can use
+either for kdb.
+Define both video and serial consoles with boot parameters
+.P
+.nf
+  console=tty0 console=ttyS0,38400
+.fi
+.P
+Any kdb data entered on the keyboard or the serial console will be echoed
+to both.
+.P
+If you are using a USB keyboard then kdb commands cannot be entered
+until the kernel has initialised the USB subsystem and recognised the
+keyboard.
+Using kdb=early with a USB keyboard will not work, the USB subsystem is
+initialised too late.
+.P
+While kdb is active, the keyboard (not serial console) indicators may strobe.
+The caps lock and scroll lock lights will turn on and off, num lock is not used
+because it can confuse laptop keyboards where the numeric keypad is mapped over
+the normal keys.
+On exit from kdb the keyboard indicators will probably be wrong, they will not match the kernel state.
+Pressing caps lock twice should get the indicators back in sync with
+the kernel.
+.SH "Basic Commands"
+There are several categories of commands available to the
+kernel debugger user including commands providing memory
+display and modification, register display and modification,
+instruction disassemble, breakpoints and stack tracebacks.
+Any command can be prefixed with '-' which will cause kdb to ignore any
+errors on that command, this is useful when packaging commands using
+defcmd.
+A line whose first non-space character is '#' is printed and ignored.
+.P
+The following table shows the currently implemented standard commands,
+these are always available.  Other commands can be added by extra
+debugging modules, type '?' at the kdb prompt to get a list of all
+available commands.

+Some of the commands are described here.
+Information on the more complicated commands can be found in the
+appropriate manual pages.
+.TP 8
+cpu
+With no parameters, it lists the available cpus.
+\&'*' after a cpu number indicates a cpu that did not respond to the kdb
+stop signal.
+\&'+' after a cpu number indicates a cpu for which kdb has some data, but
+that cpu is no longer responding to kdb, so you cannot switch to it.
+This could be a cpu that has failed after entering kdb, or the cpu may
+have saved its state for debugging then entered the prom, this is
+normal for an IA64 MCA event.
+\&'I' after a cpu number means that the cpu was idle before it entered
+kdb, it is unlikely to contain any useful data.
+\&'F' after a cpu number means that the cpu is offline.
+There is currenly no way to distinguish between cpus that used to be
+online but are now offline and cpus that were never online, the kernel
+does not maintain the information required to separate those two cases.
+.I cpu
+followed by a number will switch to that cpu, you cannot switch to
+a cpu marked '*', '+' or 'F'.
+This command is only available if the kernel was configured for SMP.
+.TP 8
+dmesg [lines] [adjust]
+Displays the system messages from the kernel buffer.
+If kdb logging is on, it is disabled by dmesg and is left as disabled.
+With no parameters or a zero value for 'lines', dmesg dumps the entire
+kernel buffer.
+If lines is specified and is positive, dmesg dumps the last 'lines'
+from the buffer.
+If lines is specified and is negative, dmesg dumps the first 'lines'
+from the buffer.
+If adjust is specified, adjust the starting point for the lines that
+are printed.
+When 'lines' is positive, move the starting point back by 'adjust'
+lines, when 'lines' is negative, move the starting point forward by
+\&'adjust' lines.
+.I dmesg -100
+will dump 100 lines, from the start of the buffer.
+.I dmesg 100
+will dump 100 lines, starting 100 lines from the end of the buffer,
+.I dmesg 100 100
+will dump 100 lines, starting 200 lines from the end of the buffer.
+.I dmesg -100 100
+will dump 100 lines, starting 100 lines from the start of the buffer.
+.TP 8
+defcmd
+Defines a new command as a set of other commands, all input until
+.I endefcmd
+is saved and executed as a package.
+.I defcmd
+takes three parameters, the command name to be defined and used to
+invoke the package, a quoted string containing the usage text and a
+quoted string containing the help text for the command.
+When using defcmd, it is a good idea to prefix commands that might fail
+with '-', this ignores errors so the following commands are still
+executed.
+For example,
+.P
+.nf
+        defcmd diag "" "Standard diagnostics"
+          set LINES 2000
+          set BTAPROMPT 0
+          -id %eip-0x40
+          -cpu
+          -ps
+          -dmesg 80
+          -bt
+          -bta
+        endefcmd
+.fi
+.P
+When used with no parameters, defcmd prints all the defined commands.
+.TP 8
+go
+Continue normal execution.
+Active breakpoints are reestablished and the processor(s) allowed to
+run normally.
+To continue at a specific address, use
+.I rm
+to change the instruction pointer then go.
+.TP 8
+handlers
+Control the display of IA64 MCA/INIT handlers.
+The IA64 MCA/INIT handlers run on separate tasks.
+During an MCA/INIT event, the active tasks are typically the handlers,
+rather than the original tasks, which is not very useful for debugging.
+By default, KDB hides the MCA/INIT handlers so commands such as ps and
+btc will display the original task.
+You can change this behaviour by using
+.I handlers show
+to display the MCA/INIT handlers instead of the original tasks or use
+.I handlers hide
+(the default) to hide the MCA/INIT handlers and display the original
+tasks.
+.I handlers status
+will list the address of the handler task and the original task for
+each cpu.
+\fBNote:\fR\ If the original task was running in user space or it
+failed any of the MCA/INIT verification tests then there is no original
+task to display.
+In this case, the handler will be displayed even if
+.I handlers hide
+is set and
+.I handlers status
+will not show an original task.
+.TP 8
+id
+Disassemble instructions starting at an address.
+Environment variable IDCOUNT controls how many lines of disassembly
+output the command produces.
+.TP 8
+kill
+Internal command to send a signal (like kill(1)) to a process.
+kill -signal pid.
+.TP 8
+lsmod
+Internal command to list modules.
+This does not use any kernel nor user space services so can be used at any time.
+.TP 8
+per_cpu <variable_name> [<length>] [<cpu>]
+Display the values of a per_cpu variable, the variable_name is
+specified without the \fIper_cpu__\fR prefix.
+Length is the length of the variable, 1-8, if omitted or 0 it defaults
+to the size of the machine's register.
+To display the variable on a specific cpu, the third parameter is the
+cpu number.
+When the third parameter is omitted, the variable's value is printed
+from all cpus, except that zero values are suppressed.
+For each cpu, per_cpu prints the cpu number, the address of the
+variable and its value.
+.TP 8
+pid <number>
+Change the current process context, with no parameters it displays the
+current process.
+The current process is used to display registers, both kernel and user
+space.
+It is also used when dumping user pages.
+.I pid R
+resets to the original process that was running when kdb was entered.
+This command is useful if you have been looking at other processes and/or
+cpus and you want to get back to the original process.
+It does not switch cpus, it only resets the context to the original process.
+.TP 8
+reboot
+Reboot the system, with no attempt to do a clean close down.
+.TP 8
+rq <cpu>
+Display the runqueues for the specified cpu.
+.TP 8
+rqa
+Display the runqueues for all cpus.
+.TP 8
+stackdepth <percentage>
+Print the stack usage for processes using more than the specified
+percentage of their stack.
+If percentage is not supplied, it defaults to 60.
+This command is only implemented on i386 and ia64 architectures,
+patches for other architectures will be gratefully accepted.
+.TP 8
+summary
+Print a summary of the system, including the time (no timezone is
+applied), uname information and various critical system counters.
+.SH INITIAL KDB COMMANDS
+kdb/kdb_cmds is a plain text file where you can define kdb commands
+which are to be issued during kdb_init().  One command per line, blank
+lines are ignored, lines starting with '#' are ignored.  kdb_cmds is
+intended for per user customization of kdb, you can use it to set
+environment variables to suit your hardware or to set standard
+breakpoints for the problem you are debugging.  This file is converted
+to a small C object, compiled and linked into the kernel.  You must
+rebuild and reinstall the kernel after changing kdb_cmds.  This file
+will never be shipped with any useful data so you can always override
+it with your local copy.  Sample kdb_cmds:
+.P
+.nf
+# Initial commands for kdb, alter to suit your needs.
+# These commands are executed in kdb_init() context, no SMP, no
+# processes.  Commands that require process data (including stack or
+# registers) are not reliable this early.  set and bp commands should
+# be safe.  Global breakpoint commands affect each cpu as it is booted.
+
+set LINES=50
+set MDCOUNT=25
+set RECURSE=1
+bp sys_init_module
+.fi
+.SH INTERRUPTS AND KDB
+When a kdb event occurs, one cpu (the initial cpu) enters kdb state.
+It uses a cross system interrupt to interrupt the
+other cpus and bring them all into kdb state.  All cpus run with
+interrupts disabled while they are inside kdb, this prevents most
+external events from disturbing the kernel while kdb is running.
+.B Note:
+Disabled interrupts means that any I/O that relies on interrupts cannot
+proceed while kdb is in control, devices can time out.  The clock tick
+is also disabled, machines will lose track of time while they are
+inside kdb.
+.P
+Even with interrupts disabled, some non-maskable interrupt events will
+still occur, these can disturb the kernel while you are debugging it.
+The initial cpu will still accept NMI events, assuming that kdb was not
+entered for an NMI event.  Any cpu where you use the SS or SSB commands
+will accept NMI events, even after the instruction has finished and the
+cpu is back in kdb.  This is an unavoidable side effect of the fact that
+doing SS[B] requires the cpu to drop all the way out of kdb, including
+exiting from the event that brought the cpu into kdb.  Under normal
+circumstances the only NMI event is for the NMI oopser and that is kdb
+aware so it does not disturb the kernel while kdb is running.
+.P
+Sometimes doing SS or SSB on ix86 will allow one interrupt to proceed,
+even though the cpu is disabled for interrupts.  I have not been able
+to track this one down but I suspect that the interrupt was pending
+when kdb was entered and it runs when kdb exits through IRET even
+though the popped flags are marked as cli().  If any ix86 hardware
+expert can shed some light on this problem, please notify the kdb
+maintainer.
+.SH RECOVERING FROM KDB ERRORS
+If a kdb command breaks and kdb has enough of a recovery environment
+then kdb will abort the command and drop back into mainline kdb code.
+This means that user written kdb commands can follow bad pointers
+without killing kdb.  Ideally all code should verify that data areas
+are valid (using kdb_getarea) before accessing it but lots of calls to
+kdb_getarea can be clumsy.
+.P
+The sparc64 port does not currently provide this error recovery.
+If someone would volunteer to write the necessary longjmp/setjmp
+code, their efforts would be greatly appreciated. In the
+meantime, it is possible for kdb to trigger a panic by accessing
+a bad address.
+.SH DEBUGGING THE DEBUGGER
+kdb has limited support for debugging problems within kdb.  If you
+suspect that kdb is failing, you can set environment variable KDBDEBUG
+to a bit pattern which will activate kdb_printf statements within kdb.
+See include/linux/kdb.h, KDB_DEBUG_FLAG_xxx defines.  For example
+.nf
+  set KDBDEBUG=0x60
+.fi
+activates the event callbacks into kdb plus state tracing in sections
+of kdb.
+.nf
+  set KDBDEBUG=0x18
+.fi
+gives lots of tracing as kdb tries to decode the process stack.
+.P
+You can also perform one level of recursion in kdb.  If environment
+variable RECURSE is not set or is 0 then kdb will either recover from
+an error (if the recovery environment is satisfactory) or kdb will
+allow the error to percolate, usually resulting in a dead system.  When
+RECURSE is 1 then kdb will recover from an error or, if there is no
+satisfactory recovery environment, it will drop into kdb state to let
+you diagnose the problem.  When RECURSE is 2 then all errors drop into
+kdb state, kdb does not attempt recovery first.  Errors while in
+recursive state all drop through, kdb does not even attempt to recover
+from recursive errors.
+.SH KEYBOARD EDITING
+kdb supports a command history, which can be accessed via keyboard
+sequences.
+It supports the special keys on PC keyboards, control characters and
+vt100 sequences on a serial console or a PC keyboard.
+.P
+.DS
+.TS

+.TE

+.P
+There is no toggle for insert/replace mode, kdb editing is always in
+insert mode.
+Use delete and backspace to delete characters.
+.P
+kdb also supports tab completion for kernel symbols
+Type the start of a kernel symbol and press tab (ctrl-I) to complete
+the name
+If there is more than one possible match, kdb will append any common
+characters and wait for more input, pressing tab a second time will
+display the possible matches
+The number of matches is limited by environment variable DTABCOUNT,
+with a default of 30 if that variable is not set.

+.SH SYNOPSIS
+bp \fIaddress-expression\fP
+.LP
+bpa \fIaddress-expression\fP
+.LP

+.LP
+be \fIbreakpoint-number\fP
+.LP
+bl
+.SH DESCRIPTION
+.hy 0
+The
+.B bp
+family of commands are used to establish a breakpoint.
+The \fIaddress-expression\fP may be a numeric value (decimal or
+hexidecimal), a symbol name, a register name preceeded by a
+percent symbol '%', or a simple expression consisting of a
+symbol name, an addition or subtraction character and a numeric
+value (decimal or hexidecimal).
+.P
+\fBbph\fP and \fBbpha\fP will force the use of a hardware register, provided
+the processor architecture supports them.
+.P
+The \fIaddress-expression\fP may also consist of a single
+asterisk '*' symbol which indicates that the command should
+operate on all existing breakpoints (valid only for \fBbc\fP,
+\fBbd\fP and \fBbe\fP).
+.P
+Four different types of
+breakpoints may be set:
+
+.TP 8
+Instruction
+Causes the kernel debugger to be invoked from the debug exception
+path when an instruction is fetched from the specified address.  This
+is the default if no other type of breakpoint is requested or when
+the \fBbp\fP command is used.
+
+.TP 8
+DATAR
+Causes the kernel debugger to be entered when data of length
+\fIlength\fP is read from or written to the specified address.
+This type of breakpoint must use a processor debug register which
+places an architecture dependent limit on the number of data and I/O
+breakpoints that may be established. On arm mode XScale platform
+(thumb mode is not supported yet),
+debugger is triggered by reading from the specified address.
+The \fBbph\fP or \fBbpha\fP commands must be used.
+
+.TP 8
+DATAW
+Enters the kernel debugger when data of length \fIlength\fP
+is written to the specified address.  \fIlength\fP defaults
+to four bytes if it is not explicitly specified.
+Note that the processor may have already overwritten the prior data at
+the breakpoint location before the kernel debugger is invoked.
+The prior data should be saved before establishing the breakpoint, if
+required. On arm mode XScale platform, the debugger is triggered
+after having overwritten the specified address.
+The \fBbph\fP or \fBbpha\fP commands must be used.
+
+.TP 8
+IO
+Enters the kernel debugger when an \fBin\fP or \fBout\fP instruction
+targets the specified I/O address.  The \fBbph\fP or \fBbpha\fP
+commands must be used. This type of breakpoint is not valid in
+arm mode XScale platform. This option is not valid in arm
+mode XScale platform.
+
+.TP 8
+DATAA
+Enters the kernel debugger after the data in specified address has
+been accessed (read or write), this option is only used in arm
+mode XScale platform.
+
+.P
+The
+.B bpha
+command will establish a breakpoint on all processors in an
+SMP system.   This command is not available in an uniprocessor
+kernel.
+.P
+The
+.B bd
+command will disable a breakpoint without removing it from the kernel
+debugger's breakpoint table.
+This can be used to keep breakpoints in the table without exceeding the
+architecture limit on breakpoint registers.
+A breakpoint-number of \fI*\fR will disable all break points.
+.P
+The
+.B be
+command will re-enable a disabled breakpoint.
+A breakpoint-number of \fI*\fR will enable all break points.
+.P
+The
+.B bc
+command will clear a breakpoint from the breakpoint table.
+A breakpoint-number of \fI*\fR will clear all break points.
+.P
+The
+.B bl
+command will list the existing set of breakpoints.
+.SH LIMITATIONS
+There is a compile time limit of sixteen entries in the
+breakpoint table at any one time.
+.P
+There are architecture dependent limits on the number of hardware
+breakpoints that can be set.
+.IP ix86 8
+Four.
+.PD 0
+.IP xscale 8
+Two for insruction breakpoints and another two for data breakpoint.
+.PD 0
+.IP ia64 8
+?
+.PD 0
+.IP sparc64 8
+None.
+.PD 1
+When issuing the "go" command after entering the debugger due to
+a breakpoint, kdb will silently perform a single step in order to
+reapply the breakpoint. The sparc64 port has some limitations on
+single stepping, which may limit where a breakpoint may be safely
+set. Please read the man page for \fBss\fP for more information.
+.SH ENVIRONMENT
+The breakpoint subsystem does not currently use any environment
+variables.
+.SH SMP CONSIDERATIONS
+Using
+.B bc
+is risky on SMP systems.
+If you clear a breakpoint when another cpu has hit that breakpoint but
+has not been processed then it may not be recognised as a kdb
+breakpoint, usually resulting in incorrect program counters and kernel
+panics.
+It is safer to disable the breakpoint with
+.BR bd ,
+then
+.B go
+to let any other processors that are waiting on the breakpoint to
+clear.
+After all processors are clear of the disabled breakpoint then it is
+safe to clear it using
+.BR bc .
+.P
+Breakpoints which use the processor breakpoint registers
+are only established on the processor which is
+currently active.  If you wish breakpoints to be universal
+use the
+.B bpa
+or
+.B bpha
+commands.
+.SH EXAMPLES
+.TP 8
+bp schedule
+Sets an instruction breakpoint at the begining of the
+function \fBschedule\fP.
+
+.TP 8
+bp schedule+0x12e
+Sets an instruction breakpoint at the instruction located

+
+.TP 8
+bph ttybuffer+0x24 dataw
+Sets a data write breakpoint at the location referenced by
+\fBttybuffer\fP+\fI0x24\fP for a length of four bytes.
+
+.TP 8

+.SH NAME
+bt \- Stack Traceback command
+.SH SYNOPSIS
+bt [ <stack-frame-address> ]
+.LP
+btp <pid>
+.LP
+btt <struct-task-address>
+.LP
+bta [ DRSTZUIMA ]
+.LP
+btc [<cpu>]
+.SH DESCRIPTION
+.hy 0
+The
+.B bt
+command is used to print a stack traceback.  It uses the
+current registers (see \fBrd\fP command) to determine
+the starting context and attempts to provide a complete
+stack traceback for the active thread.   If \fIstack-frame-address\fP
+is supplied, it is assumed to point to the start of a valid
+stack frame and the stack will be traced back from that
+point.
+On x86 architecture, \fIstack-frame-address\fP must be the stack address of a
+saved \fB%eip\fP (\fB%rip\fP for x86_64) value from a \fBcall\fP instruction.
+.P
+The \fBbtp\fP command will analyze the stack for the given
+process identification (see the \fBps\fP command).
+\fBbtp\fP sets the current process for any following register display or update
+commands.
+.P
+The \fBbtt\fP command will analyze the stack for the given task
+structure.
+It is exactly equivalent to \fBbtp\fR on the pid extracted from the
+task structure.
+\fBbtt\fP sets the current process for any following register display or update
+commands.
+.P
+The \fBbta\fP command lists the stack for all processes in the desired
+state.
+Without any parameters, \fBbta\fP gives a backtrace for all useful processes.
+If a parameter is specified, it is a single string consisting of the
+letters D, R, S, T, Z, U, I, M and A in any order.
+See the kdb \fBps\fR man page for more details.
+\fBbta\fP does not change the current process.
+.P
+The \fBbtc\fP command will analyze the stack for the current process on
+a specified cpu or, if no cpu number is supplied, for the current
+process on all cpus.
+It does not switch to the other cpus, instead it uses the task
+structures to identify and issue \fBbtt\fR against the current task on
+the desired cpus.
+\fBbtc\fP with no arguments does not change the current process.
+\fBbtc\fP with a cpu number sets the current process for any following register
+display or update commands.
+.P
+For each function, the stack trace prints at least two lines.
+The first line contains four or five fields\ :-
+.IP * 3
+The pointer to the stack frame.
+.PD 0
+.IP * 3
+The current address within this frame.
+.IP * 3
+The address converted to a function name (actually the first non-local
+label which is <= the address).
+.IP * 3
+The offset of the address within the function.
+.IP * 3
+Any parameters to the function.
+.PD 1
+.PP
+If environment variable NOSECT is set to 0 then the next line contains
+five fields which are designed to make it easier to match the trace
+against the kernel code\ :-
+.IP * 3
+The module name that contains the address, "kernel" if it is in the
+base kernel.
+.PD 0
+.IP * 3
+The section name that contains the address (not available on 2.6 kernels).
+.IP * 3
+The start address of the section (not available on 2.6 kernels).
+.IP * 3
+The start address of the function.
+.IP * 3
+The end address of the function (the first non-local label which is >
+the address).
+.PD 1
+.PP
+If arguments are being converted to symbols, any argument which
+converts to a kernel or module address is printed as\ :-
+.IP * 3
+Argument address.
+.PD 0
+.IP * 3
+The module name that contains the address, "kernel" if it is in the
+base kernel.
+.IP * 3
+The symbol name the argument maps to.
+.IP * 3
+The offset of the argument from the symbol, suppressed if 0.
+.PD 1
+.P
+On architectures that use nested stacks, the backtrace will indicate a
+switch to a new stack by printing a line of equal signs and the type of
+stack.
+.SH MATCHING TRACE TO KERNEL CODE
+The command "objdump\ -S" will disassemble an object and, if the code
+was compiled with debugging (gcc flag -g), objdump will interleave the
+C source lines with the generated object.
+.PP
+A complete objdump of the kernel or a module is too big, normally you
+only want specific functions.
+By default objdump will only print the .text section but Linux uses
+other section names for executable code.
+When objdump prints relocatable objects (modules) it uses an offset of
+0 which is awkward to relate to the stack trace.
+The five fields which are printed for each function are designed to
+make it easier to match the stack trace against the kernel code using
+"objdump\ -S".
+.PP
+If the function is in the kernel then you need the section name, the
+start and end address of the function.  The command is
+.PP
+.nf
+  objdump -S -j <section_name> \\
+          --start-address=<start-address> \\
+          --stop-address=<end-address> \\
+          /usr/src/linux/vmlinux
+.fi
+.PP
+If the function is in a module then you need the section name, the
+start address of the section, the start and end address of the
+function, the module name.  The command is
+.PP
+.nf
+  objdump -S -j <section_name> \\
+          --adjust-vma=<section-start> \\
+          --start-address=<start-address> \\
+          --stop-address=<end-address> \\
+          /path/to/module/<module-name>.o
+.fi
+.PP
+Unfortunately the 2.6 kernel does not provide the information required
+to locate the start of the section, which makes it very difficult to
+perform a reliable objdump on a module.
+.PP
+All addresses to objdump must be preceded by '0x' if they are in hex,
+objdump does not assume hex.
+The stack trace values are printed with leading '0x' to make it easy to
+run objdump.
+.SH LIMITATIONS
+Some architectures pass parameters in registers; ia64, x86_64 and i386 (with
+gcc flag -mregparm) fall into this category.
+On these architectures, the compiler may reuse input parameter registers as
+scratch space.
+For example, if a function takes a pointer to a structure and only accesses one
+field in that structure, the compiler may calculate the address of the field by
+adding a value to the input register.
+Once the input register has been updated, it no longer points to the
+start of the structure, but to some field within it.
+This also occurs with array pointers, the compiler may update the input pointer
+directly, leaving it pointing to some element of the array instead of the start
+of the array.
+Always treat parameter values that have been passed in registers with extreme
+suspicion, the compiler may have changed the value.
+The x86 backtrace can generally identify register parameters that are no longer
+valid, it prints them as 'invalid' instead of as a misleading number.
+The ia64 backtrace cannot identify parameter registers that have been
+overwritten.
+.P
+x86 architectures do not have full unwind information in the kernel.
+The KDB backtrace on x86 performs code decomposition and analysis to track the
+frames on the call stack (including stack switches) and to locate parameters.
+if this code analysis does not yield a valid result, KDB falls back on the old
+method of scanning the process stack and printing anything that looks like a
+kernel address.
+This old method is unreliable (it produces lots of false positives in the
+trace) and cannot track parameters at all, so no parameters are printed.
+If you get an x86 backtrace that falls back to the old method, read
+Documentation/kdb/bt_x86 and follow the steps listed to get diagnostics and to
+submit a bug report.
+.P
+There are a lot of functions in the kernel which take some arguments then do
+nothing except call another function with the same initial arguments, sometimes
+adding parameters at the end.  For example\ :-
+.nf
+.na
+.ft CW
+
+int ipv4_doint_and_flush_strategy(ctl_table *table, int __user *name, int nlen,
+				  void __user *oldval, size_t __user *oldlenp,
+				  void __user *newval, size_t newlen)
+{
+	int ret = devinet_conf_sysctl(table, name, nlen, oldval, oldlenp,
+				      newval, newlen);
+
+	if (ret == 1)
+		rt_cache_flush(0);
+
+	return ret;
+}
+.ad b
+.fi
+.P
+ipv4_doint_and_flush_strategy() passes all its parameters directly to
+devinet_conf_sysctl() and makes no other use of those parameters,
+so ipv4_doint_and_flush_strategy is a 'pass through' function.
+The x86_64 calling sequence mandates that the first 6 parameters are passed in
+registers, with other parameters being passed on stack.
+The i386 calling sequence with -mregparm=3 (which is the default since about
+2.6.18) passes the first 3 parameters in registers, with other parameters being
+passed on stack.
+The only exceptions to the above calling sequence are for functions declared as
+asmlinkage or functions with a variable number of parameters (e.g. printk).
+.P
+When a pass through function calls another function, the first 3 (i386) or 6
+(x86) parameters are already in their correct registers so the pass through
+function does not need to access the registers, which means that there are no
+references to these registers in the assembler code for the function.
+Users still want to see those arguments so the x86 backtrace has to assume that
+if\ :-
+.IP * 2
+There are parameters passed on the stack and
+.IP *
+There are no code references to parameters passed in registers and
+.IP *
+The function is not a known asmlinkage or variadic function, then
+there are pass through register arguments.
+.P
+The x86 backtrace will warn you when it makes this assumption, like this\ :-
+.nf
+.na
+.ft CW
+
+  <function_name> has memory parameters but no register parameters.
+  Assuming it is a 'pass through' function that does not refer to its register
+  parameters and setting <n> register parameters
+.ad b
+.fi
+.P
+The above 3 line message is only printed once, any future assumptions will
+print a shorter message.
+.P
+The \fBbt\fP command may print more or less arguments for a function
+than that function accepts.
+For x86, trailing arguments that are passed in but not used by the function
+will not be printed, resulting in fewer arguments than expected.
+For ia64, the hardware does not distinguish between input and local registers,
+some local registers may be printed as function arguments, resulting in more
+arguments than expected.
+.P
+On i386, 64 bit arguments (long long) occupy two adjacent 32 bit fields.
+There is no way for KDB to tell that this has occurred, so 64 bit arguments
+will be printed as two separate 32 bit arguments.
+.SH ENVIRONMENT
+The \fBBTARGS\fP environment variable governs the maximum number
+of arguments that are printed for any single function.
+On IA64 hardware, there is no difference between input and local registers, the
+first \fBBTARGS\fP registers are printed, up to the total limit of input plus
+local registers.
+Use a large value for \fBBTARGS\fP if you want to see the local registers on
+IA64.
+.PP
+If the \fBBTSP\fP environment variable is non-zero then the entire backtrace is
+printed, otherwise only the backtrace to the point of the last interrupt is
+printed.
+Printing the entire backtrace with 'set\ BTSP\ 1' is useful for diagnosing
+problems with the backtrace algorithms.
+In addition, when BTSP is non-zero, each backtrace frame may print extra lines
+giving information about the stack pointers, this is architecture specific.
+.PP
+If the \fBBTSYMARG\fP environment variable is non-zero then any
+arguments that fall within the kernel or modules are converted to symbols.
+.PP
+If the \fBNOSECT\fP environment variable is non-zero then the
+section information is suppressed.
+The default is NOSECT=1 so section data is suppressed; use set\ NOSECT=0
+to see section information.
+.PP
+The \fBBTAPROMPT\fP environment variable controls the prompt after each
+process is listed by the \fBbta\fP command.  If \fBBTAPROMPT\fP is not
+set or is non-zero then \fBbta\fP issues a prompt after each process is
+listed.  If \fBBTAPROMPT\fP is set to zero then no prompt is issued and
+all processes are listed without human intervention.
+.PP
+\fBbt\fR with no parameters uses the \fBPS\fR environment variable, see
+the kdb \fBps\fR man page.

+percent symbols '%', an environment variable name preceeded by
+a currency symbol '$',  or a simple expression consisting of a
+symbol name, an addition or subtraction character and a numeric
+value (decimal or hexidecimal).
+.P
+If an address is specified and the \fIline-count\fP or \fIradix\fP arguments
+are omitted, they default to the values of the \fBMDCOUNT\fP and \fBRADIX\fP
+environment variables respectively.  If the \fBMDCOUNT\fP or \fBRADIX\fP
+environment variables are unset, the appropriate defaults will be used [see
+\fBENVIRONMENT\fP below].  If no address is specified then md resumes
+after the last address printed, using the previous values of count and
+radix.  The start address is rounded down to a multiple of the
+BYTESPERWORD (md) or width (md\fIW\fR).
+.P
+md uses the current value of environment variable \fBBYTESPERWORD\fP to
+read the data.  When reading hardware registers that require special
+widths, it is more convenient to use md\fIW\fRc\fIn\fR where \fIW\fR is
+the width for this command and \fRc\fIn\fR is the number of entries to
+read.  For example, md1c20 reads 20 bytes, 1 at a time.  To continue
+printing just type md, the width and count apply to following md
+commands with no parameters.  \fBNote:\fR The count is the number of
+repeats of the width, unlike MDCOUNT which gives the number of md lines
+to print.
+.P
+The
+.B mdp
+command displays the contents of physical memory, starting at the
+specified physical address for the specified number of bytes.
+The address is preceded by 'phys'.
+.P
+The
+.B mdr
+command displays the raw contents of memory, starting at the specified
+address for the specified number of bytes.
+The data is printed in one line without a leading address and no
+trailing character conversion.
+.B mdr
+is intended for interfacing with external debuggers, it is of little
+use to humans.
+.P
+The
+.B mds
+command displays the contents of memory one word per line and
+attempts to correlate the contents of each word with a symbol
+in the symbol table.   If no symbol is found, the ascii representation
+of the word is printed, otherwise the symbol name and offset from
+symbol value are printed.
+By default the section data is printed for kernel symbols.
+.P
+The
+.B mm
+and
+\fBmm\fIW\fR
+commands allow modification of memory.   The bytes at the address
+represented by \fIaddress-expression\fP are changed to
+\fInew-contents\fP.  \fInew-contents\fP is allowed to be an
+\fIaddress-expression\fP.
+.B mm
+changes a machine word, \fBmm\fIW\fR changes \fIW\fR bytes at that
+address.
+.SH LIMITATIONS
+None.
+.SH ENVIRONMENT
+.TP 8
+MDCOUNT
+This environment variable (default=8) defines the number of lines
+that will be displayed by each invocation of the \fBmd\fP command.
+
+.TP 8
+RADIX
+This environment variable (default=16) defines the radix used to
+print the memory contents.
+
+.TP 8
+BYTESPERWORD
+This environment variable (default=4) selects the width of output

+16-bit word output, select the value one to get byte output.
+
+.TP 8
+LINES
+This environment variable governs the number of lines of output
+that will be presented before the kernel debugger built-in pager

+.SH NAME
+ps \- Display processes
+.SH SYNOPSIS
+ps [ DRSTCZEUIMA ]
+.SH DESCRIPTION
+The
+.B ps
+command displays the status of all processes in the desired state.
+This command does not take any locks (all cpus should be frozen while
+kdb is running) so it can safely be used to debug lock problems with
+the process table.
+.P
+Without any parameters, \fBps\fP displays all the interesting
+processes, excluding idle tasks and sleeping system daemons.
+If a parameter is specified, it is a single string consisting of the
+letters D, R, S, T, C, Z, E, U, I and M, in any order.
+Each letter selects processes in a specific state, when multiple
+letters are specified, a process will be displayed if it is in any of
+the specified states.
+The states are\ :-
+.P
+.DS
+.TS
+box, center;
+l | l
+l | l.
+D	Uninterruptible sleep
+R	Running
+S	Interruptible sleep
+T	Stopped
+C	Traced
+Z	Zombie
+E	Dead
+U	Unrunnable
+I	Idle task
+M	Sleeping system daemon
+A	All
+.TE
+.DE
+.P
+For state R (running), the process may not be on a cpu at the moment,
+but it is ready to run.
+The header line above the backtrace contains '1' in the fourth field if
+the process is actually on a cpu.
+.P
+The idle task is run on each cpu when there is no work for that cpu to do.
+Unless the idle task is servicing an interrupt, there is no point in
+printing the idle task.
+An idle task that is not servicing a interrupt is marked as state I,
+while servicing an interrupt it is in state R.
+By default, idle tasks are not printed, use \fBps\ I\fR to print them.
+If the idle tasks are not being printed, the start of the \fBps\R
+output contains a list of which cpus are idle.
+.P
+Each cpu has one or more system daemons to handle per cpu work such as
+soft irqs.
+A system daemon (idenified by a NULL mm pointer) that is sleeping is
+marked as state M.
+These processes rarely have any useful data and generate a lot of
+output on large machines, so sleeping system daemons are not printed by
+default.
+Use \fBps\ M\fR to print them.
+.P
+At the start of the \fBps\fR output is a line giving the cpu status,
+see the kdb \fBcpu\fR command.
+.SH LIMITATIONS
+None.
+.SH ENVIRONMENT
+.TP 8
+PS
+This environment variable (default=DRSTCZEU) is used when \fBps\fR
+is issued with no parameters.

+.SH SYNOPSIS
+rd [[c [n]]|d|u]
+.LP
+rm \fIregister-name\fP \fInew-contents\fP
+.LP
+ef <address>
+.SH DESCRIPTION
+The
+.B rd
+command is used to display the contents of processor and coprocessor registers.
+Without any arguments, the rd command displays the contents of the general
+register set at the point at which the kernel debugger was entered.
+If the bt* or pid commands have been used to change the current process then
+.B rd
+and
+.B rm
+may not be able to display any registers.
+'n' argument is only used for XScale platform to identify the desired
+coprocessor number, while 'd' option is not valid for XScale platform.
+.P
+On IA32 and IA64, with the 'c' argument, the processor control registers
+%cr0, %cr1, %cr2 and %cr4 are displayed, while with the 'd' argument
+the processor debug registers are displayed.  If the 'u' argument
+is supplied, the registers for the current task as of the last
+time the current task entered the kernel are displayed.
+.P
+On XScale, 'c' argument is used to display the
+all coprocessor control registers or specified coprocessor registers by
+argumnet 'n'. Argument 'u' is used to display the
+registers for the current task as of the last time the current task
+entered the kernel. Argument 'd' is not supported.
+.P
+On ix86, the
+.B rm
+command allows modification of a register.  The following
+register names are valid:  \fB%eax\fP, \fB%ebx\fP, \fB%ecx\fP,
+\fB%edx\fP, \fB%esi\fP, \fB%edi\fP, \fB%esp\fP, \fB%eip\fP,
+and \fB%ebp\fP.   Note that if two '%' symbols are used
+consecutively, the register set displayed by the 'u' argument
+to the \fBrd\fP command is modified.
+.P
+The debug registers, \fBdr0\fP through \fBdr3\fP and both
+\fBdr6\fP and \fBdr7\fP can also be modified with the \fBrm\fP
+command.
+.P
+On sparc64, the valid registers are named \fB%g0\fP through
+\fB%g7\fP, \fB%l0\fP through \fB%l7\fP, \fB%o0\fP through
+\fB%o7\fP, and \fB%i0\fP through \fB%i7\fP, with the exceptions
+that \fB%o6\fP is called \fB%sp\fP and that \fB%i6\fP is called
+\fB%fp\fP. The registers \fB%tstate\fP, \fB%tpc\fP, \fB%tnpc\fP,
+\fB%y\fP, and \fB%fprs\fP provide state information at the time
+the system entered kdb. Additionally, when viewing registers, two
+convenience names are provided: \fB%&regs\fP shows the
+address on the stack of the current registers, and \fB%csp\fP
+shows the current stack pointer within kdb itself.
+.P
+While on XScale, both the cpu registers and most coprocessor
+registers can be be modified. \fIregister-name\fP can be followings like
+r0, r1, r2, r3, r4, r5, r6, r7, r8, r9, r10, r11, r12, r13, r14,
+r15, cpsr to address  cpu registers. For the coprocessor registers in XSacle,
+either alias name or \fICpcc[CRndd[CRmbb[Opaa]]]\fP can be used to address
+the register in coprocessor cc with CRn=dd, CRm=bb and opcode2=aa. All aa, bb, cc, dd can be
+1 or 2 decimal digitals, the default value is 0 when any of them is omitted. Name
+acc0_h and acc0_l are used to identify the high byte and
+low word of accumulator in coprocessor 0.
+.P
+On IA64, the parameter to
+.B rd
+can be d (debug registers), u (user registers at most recent entry to kernel),
+i (interrupt registers), %isr (current interrupt status), s (stacked
+registers), k (kernel registers).  You can also specify these individual
+registers -
+psr,

+.TH SR 1 "7 October 2002"
+.SH NAME
+sr \- invoke sysrq commands from kdb
+.SH SYNOPSIS
+sr \fIx\fP
+.SH DESCRIPTION
+.hy 0
+The
+.B sr
+command invokes the existing sysrq handler code in the kernel.
+This command takes a single character which is passed to sysrq
+processing, as if you had entered the sysrq key sequence followed by
+that character.
+.P
+.B Caveats:
+.P
+kdb will always call the sysrq code but sysrq may be disabled.
+If you expect to use sysrq functions during debugging then
+.IP ""
+echo "1" > /proc/sys/kernel/sysrq
+.P
+before starting the debug session.
+Alternatively issue
+.IP ""
+mm4 sysrq_enabled 1
+.P
+during debugging.
+.P
+The sysrq code prints a heading using console loglevel 7 then reverts
+to the original loglevel for the rest of the sysrq processing.
+If the rest of the sysrq output is printed at a level below your
+current loglevel then you will not see the output on the kdb console,
+the output will only appear in the printk buffer.
+It is the user's responsibility to set the loglevel correctly if they
+want to see the sysrq output on the console.
+Issue
+.IP ""
+sr 7
+.P
+before any other
+.B sr
+commands if you want to see the output on the console.
+You may even have to adjust the default message loglevel in order to
+see any output from
+.BR sr .
+See Documentation/sysctl/kernel.txt for details on setting console
+loglevels via /proc.
+You can also adjust the loglevel variables via kdb
+.BR mm ;
+on older kernels there are variables such as default_message_level, on
+newer kernels all the loglevel variables are in array console_printk,
+see kernel/printk.c for your kernel.
+.P
+Operations that require interrupt driven I/O can be invoked from kdb
+.BR sr ,
+but they will not do anything until you type 'go' to exit from kdb
+(interrupts are disabled while in kdb).
+There is no guarantee that these operations will work, if the machine
+entered kdb because of an error then interrupt driven I/O may already
+be dead.
+Do not assume that
+.B sr\ s
+does anything useful.
+.P
+The sysrq handler uses locks and calls printk which also uses locks.
+If the sysrq handler or any of the sysrq functions have to wait for a
+lock then they will never return and kdb will appear to hang.
+Invoking sysrq code from kdb is inherently unsafe.

+.TH SS 1 "17 January 2002"
+.SH NAME
+ss, ssb \- Single Step
+.SH SYNOPSIS
+ss
+.LP
+ssb
+.SH DESCRIPTION
+The
+.B ss
+command is used to execute a single instruction and return
+to the kernel debugger.
+.P
+Both the instruction that was single-stepped and the next
+instruction to execute are printed.
+.P
+The \fBssb\fP command will execute instructions from the
+current value of the instruction pointer.  Each instruction
+may be printed as it is executed, depending upon architecture;
+execution will stop at any instruction which would cause the flow
+of control to change (e.g. branch, call, interrupt instruction,
+return, etc.)
+.SH LIMITATIONS
+On sparc64, there are some circumstances where single-stepping
+can be dangerous. Do not single-step across an instruction which
+changes the interrupt-enable bit in %tstate. Do not single step
+through code which is invoked when entering or leaving the
+kernel, particularly any kernel entry code before %tl is set to
+0, or any kernel exit code after %tl is set to 1.
+.SH ENVIRONMENT
+None.
+.SH SMP CONSIDERATIONS
+Other processors are held in the kernel debugger when the instruction
+is traced.  Single stepping though code that requires a lock which is
+in use by another processor is an exercise in futility, it will never
+succeed.
+.SH INTERRUPT CONSIDERATIONS
+When a kdb event occurs, one cpu (the initial cpu) enters kdb state.
+It uses a cross system interrupt to interrupt the
+other cpus and bring them all into kdb state.  All cpus run with
+interrupts disabled while they are inside kdb, this prevents most
+external events from disturbing the kernel while kdb is running.
+.B Note:
+Disabled interrupts means that any I/O that relies on interrupts cannot
+proceed while kdb is in control, devices can time out.  The clock tick
+is also disabled, machines will lose track of time while they are
+inside kdb.
+.P
+Even with interrupts disabled, some non-maskable interrupt events
+will still occur, these can disturb the kernel while you are
+debugging it.  The initial cpu will still accept NMI events,
+assuming that kdb was not entered for an NMI event.  Any cpu
+where you use the SS or SSB commands will accept NMI events, even
+after the instruction has finished and the cpu is back in kdb.
+This is an unavoidable side effect of the fact that doing SS[B]
+requires the cpu to drop all the way out of kdb, including
+exiting from the NMI event that brought the cpu into kdb.  Under
+normal circumstances the only NMI event is for the NMI oopser and
+that is kdb aware so it does not disturb the kernel while kdb is
+running.
+.P
+Sometimes doing SS or SSB on ix86 will allow one interrupt to proceed,
+even though the cpu is disabled for interrupts.  I have not been able
+to track this one down but I suspect that the interrupt was pending
+when kdb was entered and it runs when kdb exits through IRET even
+though the popped flags are marked as cli().  If any ix86 hardware
+expert can shed some light on this problem, please notify the kdb
+maintainer.

+ * kdb_read
+ *
+ *	This function reads a string of characters, terminated by
+ *	a newline, or by reaching the end of the supplied buffer,
+ *	from the current kernel debugger console device.
+ * Parameters:
+ *	buffer	- Address of character buffer to receive input characters.
+ *	bufsize - size, in bytes, of the character buffer
+ * Returns:
+ *	Returns a pointer to the buffer containing the received
+ *	character string.  This string will be terminated by a
+ *	newline character.
+ * Locking:
+ *	No locks are required to be held upon entry to this
+ *	function.  It is not reentrant - it relies on the fact
+ *	that while kdb is running on any one processor all other
+ *	processors will be spinning at the kdb barrier.
+ * Remarks:
+ *
+ * Davidm asks, why doesn't kdb use the console abstraction;
+ * here are some reasons:
+ *      - you cannot debug the console abstraction with kdb if
+ *	  kdb uses it.
+ *      - you rely on the correct functioning of the abstraction
+ *	  in the presence of general system failures.
+ *      - You must acquire the console spinlock thus restricting
+ *	  the usability - what if the kernel fails with the spinlock
+ *	  held - one still wishes to debug such situations.
+ *      - How about debugging before the console(s) are registered?
+ *      - None of the current consoles (sercons, vt_console_driver)
+ *	  have read functions defined.
+ *	- The standard pc keyboard and terminal drivers are interrupt
+ *	  driven.   We cannot enable interrupts while kdb is active,
+ *	  so the standard input functions cannot be used by kdb.
+ *
+ * An implementation could be improved by removing the need for
+ * lock acquisition - just keep a 'struct console *kdbconsole;' global
+ * variable which refers to the preferred kdb console.
+ *
+ * The bulk of this function is architecture dependent.
+ *
+ * The buffer size must be >= 2.  A buffer size of 2 means that the caller only
+ * wants a single key.
+ *
+ * An escape key could be the start of a vt100 control sequence such as \e[D
+ * (left arrow) or it could be a character in its own right.  The standard
+ * method for detecting the difference is to wait for 2 seconds to see if there
+ * are any other characters.  kdb is complicated by the lack of a timer service
+ * (interrupts are off), by multiple input sources and by the need to sometimes
+ * return after just one key.  Escape sequence processing has to be done as
+ * states in the polling loop.

+ *
+ *	This function is the entry point for the kernel debugger.  It
+ *	provides a command parser and associated support functions to
+ *	allow examination and control of an active kernel.
+ *
+ *	The breakpoint trap code should invoke this function with
+ *	one of KDB_REASON_BREAK (int 03) or KDB_REASON_DEBUG (debug register)
+ *
+ *	the die_if_kernel function should invoke this function with
+ *	KDB_REASON_OOPS.
+ *
+ *	In single step mode, one cpu is released to run without
+ *	breakpoints.   Interrupts and NMI are reset to their original values,
+ *	the cpu is allowed to do one instruction which causes a trap
+ *	into kdb with KDB_REASON_DEBUG.
+ *
+ * Inputs:
+ *	reason		The reason KDB was invoked
+ *	error		The hardware-defined error code
+ *	regs		The exception frame at time of fault/breakpoint.  If reason
+ *			is SILENT or CPU_UP then regs is NULL, otherwise it
+ *			should always be valid.
+ * Returns:
+ *	0	KDB was invoked for an event which it wasn't responsible
+ *	1	KDB handled the event for which it was invoked.
+ * Locking:
+ *	none
+ * Remarks:
+ *	No assumptions of system state.  This function may be invoked
+ *	with arbitrary locks held.  It will stop all other processors
+ *	in an SMP environment, disable all interrupts and does not use
+ *	the operating systems keyboard driver.
+ *
+ *	This code is reentrant but only for cpu switch.  Any other
+ *	reentrancy is an error, although kdb will attempt to recover.
+ *
+ *	At the start of a kdb session the initial processor is running
+ *	kdb() and the other processors can be doing anything.  When the
+ *	initial processor calls smp_kdb_stop() the other processors are
+ *	driven through kdb_ipi which calls kdb() with reason SWITCH.
+ *	That brings all processors into this routine, one with a "real"
+ *	reason code, the other with SWITCH.
+ *
+ *	Because the other processors are driven via smp_kdb_stop(),
+ *	they enter here from the NMI handler.  Until the other
+ *	processors exit from here and exit from kdb_ipi, they will not
+ *	take any more NMI requests.  The initial cpu will still take NMI.
+ *
+ *	Multiple race and reentrancy conditions, each with different
+ *	advoidance mechanisms.
+ *
+ *	Two cpus hit debug points at the same time.
+ *
+ *	  kdb_lock and kdb_initial_cpu ensure that only one cpu gets
+ *	  control of kdb.  The others spin on kdb_initial_cpu until
+ *	  they are driven through NMI into kdb_ipi.  When the initial
+ *	  cpu releases the others from NMI, they resume trying to get
+ *	  kdb_initial_cpu to start a new event.
+ *
+ *	A cpu is released from kdb and starts a new event before the
+ *	original event has completely ended.
+ *
+ *	  kdb_previous_event() prevents any cpu from entering
+ *	  kdb_initial_cpu state until the previous event has completely
+ *	  ended on all cpus.
+ *
+ *	An exception occurs inside kdb.
+ *
+ *	  kdb_initial_cpu detects recursive entry to kdb and attempts
+ *	  to recover.  The recovery uses longjmp() which means that
+ *	  recursive calls to kdb never return.  Beware of assumptions
+ *	  like
+ *
+ *	    ++depth;
+ *	    kdb();
+ *	    --depth;
+ *
+ *	  If the kdb call is recursive then longjmp takes over and
+ *	  --depth is never executed.
+ *
+ *	NMI handling.
+ *
+ *	  NMI handling is tricky.  The initial cpu is invoked by some kdb event,
+ *	  this event could be NMI driven but usually is not.  The other cpus are
+ *	  driven into kdb() via kdb_ipi which uses NMI so at the start the other
+ *	  cpus will not accept NMI.  Some operations such as SS release one cpu
+ *	  but hold all the others.  Releasing a cpu means it drops back to
+ *	  whatever it was doing before the kdb event, this means it drops out of
+ *	  kdb_ipi and hence out of NMI status.  But the software watchdog uses
+ *	  NMI and we do not want spurious watchdog calls into kdb.  kdba_read()
+ *	  resets the watchdog counters in its input polling loop, when a kdb
+ *	  command is running it is subject to NMI watchdog events.
+ *
+ *	  Another problem with NMI handling is the NMI used to drive the other
+ *	  cpus into kdb cannot be distinguished from the watchdog NMI.  State
+ *	  flag WAIT_IPI indicates that a cpu is waiting for NMI via kdb_ipi,
+ *	  if not set then software NMI is ignored by kdb_ipi.
+ *
+ *	Cpu switching.
+ *
+ *	  All cpus are in kdb (or they should be), all but one are
+ *	  spinning on KDB_STATE(HOLD_CPU).  Only one cpu is not in
+ *	  HOLD_CPU state, only that cpu can handle commands.
+ *
+ *	Go command entered.
+ *
+ *	  If necessary, go will switch to the initial cpu first.  If the event
+ *	  was caused by a software breakpoint (assumed to be global) that
+ *	  requires single-step to get over the breakpoint then only release the
+ *	  initial cpu, after the initial cpu has single-stepped the breakpoint
+ *	  then release the rest of the cpus.  If SSBPT is not required then
+ *	  release all the cpus at once.
