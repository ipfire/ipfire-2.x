Subject: [PATCH] vfs: restore ia_file for compatibility with external modules
References: bnc#381259

 patches.apparmor/fsetattr.diff eliminated ia_file and ATTR_FILE in favor
 of providing a ->fsetattr call that used a file pointer. Until this
 patch is accepted into mainline, this patch provides the backward
 compatibility for external file system modules.
