Subject: configure HAVE_UNSTABLE_SCHED_CLOCK for SGI_SN systems

Turn on CONFIG_HAVE_UNSTABLE_SCHED_CLOCK for SGI_SN.

SGI Altix has unsynchronized itc clocks.  This results in rq->clock
occasionally being set to a time in the past by a remote cpu.

Note that it is possible that this problem may exist for other ia64
machines as well, based on the following comment for sched_clock() in
arch/ia64/kernel/head.S:

 * Return a CPU-local timestamp in nano-seconds.  This timestamp is
 * NOT synchronized across CPUs its return value must never be
 * compared against the values returned on another CPU.  The usage in
 * kernel/sched.c ensures that.
