Subject: utrace core
References: FATE#304321
Patch-mainline: no

This adds the utrace facility, a new modular interface in the kernel for
implementing user thread tracing and debugging.  This fits on top of the
tracehook_* layer, so the new code is well-isolated.

The new interface is in <linux/utrace.h> and the DocBook utrace book
describes it.  It allows for multiple separate tracing engines to work in
parallel without interfering with each other.  Higher-level tracing
facilities can be implemented as loadable kernel modules using this layer.

The new facility is made optional under CONFIG_UTRACE.
When this is not enabled, no new code is added.
It can only be enabled on machines that have all the
prerequisites and select CONFIG_HAVE_ARCH_TRACEHOOK.

In this initial version, utrace and ptrace do not play well together.
If both utrace and ptrace are attached to the same thread, they can
confuse each other about the stopping and resuming of that thread.
The old ptrace code is unchanged and nothing using ptrace should be
affected by this patch as long as utrace is not used at the same time.
A later patch will make them cooperate properly.

+
+  <para>
+    <application>utrace</application> is infrastructure code for tracing
+    and controlling user threads.  This is the foundation for writing
+    tracing engines, which can be loadable kernel modules.
+  </para>
+
+  <para>
+    The basic actors in <application>utrace</application> are the thread
+    and the tracing engine.  A tracing engine is some body of code that
+    calls into the <filename>&lt;linux/utrace.h&gt;</filename>
+    interfaces, represented by a <structname>struct
+    utrace_engine_ops</structname>.  (Usually it's a kernel module,
+    though the legacy <function>ptrace</function> support is a tracing
+    engine that is not in a kernel module.)  The interface operates on
+    individual threads (<structname>struct task_struct</structname>).
+    If an engine wants to treat several threads as a group, that is up
+    to its higher-level code.
+  </para>
+
+  <para>
+    Tracing begins by attaching an engine to a thread, using
+    <function>utrace_attach_task</function> or
+    <function>utrace_attach_pid</function>.  If successful, it returns a
+    pointer that is the handle used in all other calls.
+  </para>
+
+  </sect1>
+
+  <sect1 id="callbacks"><title>Events and Callbacks</title>
+
+  <para>
+    An attached engine does nothing by default.  An engine makes something
+    happen by requesting callbacks via <function>utrace_set_events</function>
+    and poking the thread with <function>utrace_control</function>.
+    The synchronization issues related to these two calls
+    are discussed further below in <xref linkend="teardown"/>.
+  </para>
+
+  <para>
+    Events are specified using the macro
+    <constant>UTRACE_EVENT(<replaceable>type</replaceable>)</constant>.
+    Each event type is associated with a callback in <structname>struct
+    utrace_engine_ops</structname>.  A tracing engine can leave unused
+    callbacks <constant>NULL</constant>.  The only callbacks required
+    are those used by the event flags it sets.
+  </para>
+
+  <para>
+    Many engines can be attached to each thread.  When a thread has an
+    event, each engine gets a callback if it has set the event flag for
+    that event type.  Engines are called in the order they attached.
+  </para>
+
+  <para>
+    Event reporting callbacks have details particular to the event type,
+    but are all called in similar environments and have the same
+    constraints.  Callbacks are made from safe points, where no locks
+    are held, no special resources are pinned (usually), and the
+    user-mode state of the thread is accessible.  So, callback code has
+    a pretty free hand.  But to be a good citizen, callback code should
+    never block for long periods.  It is fine to block in
+    <function>kmalloc</function> and the like, but never wait for i/o or
+    for user mode to do something.  If you need the thread to wait, use
+    <constant>UTRACE_STOP</constant> and return from the callback
+    quickly.  When your i/o finishes or whatever, you can use
+    <function>utrace_control</function> to resume the thread.
+  </para>
+
+  </sect1>
+
+  <sect1 id="safely"><title>Stopping Safely</title>
+
+  <sect2 id="well-behaved"><title>Writing well-behaved callbacks</title>
+
+  <para>
+    Well-behaved callbacks are important to maintain two essential
+    properties of the interface.  The first of these is that unrelated
+    tracing engines should not interfere with each other.  If your engine's
+    event callback does not return quickly, then another engine won't get
+    the event notification in a timely manner.  The second important
+    property is that tracing should be as noninvasive as possible to the
+    normal operation of the system overall and of the traced thread in
+    particular.  That is, attached tracing engines should not perturb a
+    thread's behavior, except to the extent that changing its user-visible
+    state is explicitly what you want to do.  (Obviously some perturbation
+    is unavoidable, primarily timing changes, ranging from small delays due
+    to the overhead of tracing, to arbitrary pauses in user code execution
+    when a user stops a thread with a debugger for examination.)  Even when
+    you explicitly want the perturbation of making the traced thread block,
+    just blocking directly in your callback has more unwanted effects.  For
+    example, the <constant>CLONE</constant> event callbacks are called when
+    the new child thread has been created but not yet started running; the
+    child can never be scheduled until the <constant>CLONE</constant>
+    tracing callbacks return.  (This allows engines tracing the parent to
+    attach to the child.)  If a <constant>CLONE</constant> event callback
+    blocks the parent thread, it also prevents the child thread from
+    running (even to process a <constant>SIGKILL</constant>).  If what you
+    want is to make both the parent and child block, then use
+    <function>utrace_attach_task</function> on the child and then use
+    <constant>UTRACE_STOP</constant> on both threads.  A more crucial
+    problem with blocking in callbacks is that it can prevent
+    <constant>SIGKILL</constant> from working.  A thread that is blocking
+    due to <constant>UTRACE_STOP</constant> will still wake up and die
+    immediately when sent a <constant>SIGKILL</constant>, as all threads
+    should.  Relying on the <application>utrace</application>
+    infrastructure rather than on private synchronization calls in event
+    callbacks is an important way to help keep tracing robustly
+    noninvasive.
+  </para>
+
+  </sect2>
+
+  <sect2 id="UTRACE_STOP"><title>Using <constant>UTRACE_STOP</constant></title>
+
+  <para>
+    To control another thread and access its state, it must be stopped
+    with <constant>UTRACE_STOP</constant>.  This means that it is
+    stopped and won't start running again while we access it.  When a
+    thread is not already stopped, <function>utrace_control</function>
+    returns <constant>-EINPROGRESS</constant> and an engine must wait
+    for an event callback when the thread is ready to stop.  The thread
+    may be running on another CPU or may be blocked.  When it is ready
+    to be examined, it will make callbacks to engines that set the
+    <constant>UTRACE_EVENT(QUIESCE)</constant> event bit.  To wake up an
+    interruptible wait, use <constant>UTRACE_INTERRUPT</constant>.
+  </para>
+
+  <para>
+    As long as some engine has used <constant>UTRACE_STOP</constant> and
+    not called <function>utrace_control</function> to resume the thread,
+    then the thread will remain stopped.  <constant>SIGKILL</constant>
+    will wake it up, but it will not run user code.  When the stop is
+    cleared with <function>utrace_control</function> or a callback
+    return value, the thread starts running again.
+    (See also <xref linkend="teardown"/>.)

+
+  <sect1 id="teardown"><title>Tear-down Races</title>
+
+  <sect2 id="SIGKILL"><title>Primacy of <constant>SIGKILL</constant></title>
+  <para>
+    Ordinarily synchronization issues for tracing engines are kept fairly
+    straightforward by using <constant>UTRACE_STOP</constant>.  You ask a
+    thread to stop, and then once it makes the
+    <function>report_quiesce</function> callback it cannot do anything else
+    that would result in another callback, until you let it with a
+    <function>utrace_control</function> call.  This simple arrangement
+    avoids complex and error-prone code in each one of a tracing engine's
+    event callbacks to keep them serialized with the engine's other
+    operations done on that thread from another thread of control.
+    However, giving tracing engines complete power to keep a traced thread
+    stuck in place runs afoul of a more important kind of simplicity that
+    the kernel overall guarantees: nothing can prevent or delay
+    <constant>SIGKILL</constant> from making a thread die and release its
+    resources.  To preserve this important property of
+    <constant>SIGKILL</constant>, it as a special case can break
+    <constant>UTRACE_STOP</constant> like nothing else normally can.  This
+    includes both explicit <constant>SIGKILL</constant> signals and the
+    implicit <constant>SIGKILL</constant> sent to each other thread in the
+    same thread group by a thread doing an exec, or processing a fatal
+    signal, or making an <function>exit_group</function> system call.  A
+    tracing engine can prevent a thread from beginning the exit or exec or
+    dying by signal (other than <constant>SIGKILL</constant>) if it is
+    attached to that thread, but once the operation begins, no tracing
+    engine can prevent or delay all other threads in the same thread group
+    dying.
+  </para>
+  </sect2>
+
+  <sect2 id="reap"><title>Final callbacks</title>
+  <para>
+    The <function>report_reap</function> callback is always the final event
+    in the life cycle of a traced thread.  Tracing engines can use this as
+    the trigger to clean up their own data structures.  The
+    <function>report_death</function> callback is always the penultimate
+    event a tracing engine might see; it's seen unless the thread was
+    already in the midst of dying when the engine attached.  Many tracing
+    engines will have no interest in when a parent reaps a dead process,
+    and nothing they want to do with a zombie thread once it dies; for
+    them, the <function>report_death</function> callback is the natural
+    place to clean up data structures and detach.  To facilitate writing
+    such engines robustly, given the asynchrony of
+    <constant>SIGKILL</constant>, and without error-prone manual
+    implementation of synchronization schemes, the
+    <application>utrace</application> infrastructure provides some special
+    guarantees about the <function>report_death</function> and
+    <function>report_reap</function> callbacks.  It still takes some care
+    to be sure your tracing engine is robust to tear-down races, but these
+    rules make it reasonably straightforward and concise to handle a lot of
+    corner cases correctly.
+  </para>
+  </sect2>
+
+  <sect2 id="refcount"><title>Engine and task pointers</title>
+  <para>
+    The first sort of guarantee concerns the core data structures
+    themselves.  <structname>struct utrace_attached_engine</structname> is
+    a reference-counted data structure.  While you hold a reference, an
+    engine pointer will always stay valid so that you can safely pass it to
+    any <application>utrace</application> call.  Each call to
+    <function>utrace_attach_task</function> or
+    <function>utrace_attach_pid</function> returns an engine pointer with a
+    reference belonging to the caller.  You own that reference until you
+    drop it using <function>utrace_engine_put</function>.  There is an
+    implicit reference on the engine while it is attached.  So if you drop
+    your only reference, and then use
+    <function>utrace_attach_task</function> without
+    <constant>UTRACE_ATTACH_CREATE</constant> to look up that same engine,
+    you will get the same pointer with a new reference to replace the one
+    you dropped, just like calling <function>utrace_engine_get</function>.
+    When an engine has been detached, either explicitly with
+    <constant>UTRACE_DETACH</constant> or implicitly after
+    <function>report_reap</function>, then any references you hold are all
+    that keep the old engine pointer alive.
+  </para>
+
+  <para>
+    There is nothing a kernel module can do to keep a <structname>struct
+    task_struct</structname> alive outside of
+    <function>rcu_read_lock</function>.  When the task dies and is reaped
+    by its parent (or itself), that structure can be freed so that any
+    dangling pointers you have stored become invalid.
+    <application>utrace</application> will not prevent this, but it can
+    help you detect it safely.  By definition, a task that has been reaped
+    has had all its engines detached.  All
+    <application>utrace</application> calls can be safely called on a
+    detached engine if the caller holds a reference on that engine pointer,
+    even if the task pointer passed in the call is invalid.  All calls
+    return <constant>-ESRCH</constant> for a detached engine, which tells
+    you that the task pointer you passed could be invalid now.  Since
+    <function>utrace_control</function> and
+    <function>utrace_set_events</function> do not block, you can call those
+    inside a <function>rcu_read_lock</function> section and be sure after
+    they don't return <constant>-ESRCH</constant> that the task pointer is
+    still valid until <function>rcu_read_unlock</function>.  The
+    infrastructure never holds task references of its own.  Though neither
+    <function>rcu_read_lock</function> nor any other lock is held while
+    making a callback, it's always guaranteed that the <structname>struct
+    task_struct</structname> and the <structname>struct
+    utrace_attached_engine</structname> passed as arguments remain valid
+    until the callback function returns.
+  </para>
+
+  <para>
+    The common means for safely holding task pointers that is available to
+    kernel modules is to use <structname>struct pid</structname>, which
+    permits <function>put_pid</function> from kernel modules.  When using
+    that, the calls <function>utrace_attach_pid</function>,
+    <function>utrace_control_pid</function>,
+    <function>utrace_set_events_pid</function>, and
+    <function>utrace_barrier_pid</function> are available.
+  </para>
+  </sect2>
+
+  <sect2 id="reap-after-death">
+    <title>
+      Serialization of <constant>DEATH</constant> and <constant>REAP</constant>
+    </title>
+    <para>
+      The second guarantee is the serialization of
+      <constant>DEATH</constant> and <constant>REAP</constant> event
+      callbacks for a given thread.  The actual reaping by the parent
+      (<function>release_task</function> call) can occur simultaneously
+      while the thread is still doing the final steps of dying, including
+      the <function>report_death</function> callback.  If a tracing engine
+      has requested both <constant>DEATH</constant> and
+      <constant>REAP</constant> event reports, it's guaranteed that the
+      <function>report_reap</function> callback will not be made until
+      after the <function>report_death</function> callback has returned.
+      If the <function>report_death</function> callback itself detaches
+      from the thread, then the <function>report_reap</function> callback
+      will never be made.  Thus it is safe for a
+      <function>report_death</function> callback to clean up data
+      structures and detach.
+    </para>
+  </sect2>
+
+  <sect2 id="interlock"><title>Interlock with final callbacks</title>
+  <para>
+    The final sort of guarantee is that a tracing engine will know for sure
+    whether or not the <function>report_death</function> and/or
+    <function>report_reap</function> callbacks will be made for a certain
+    thread.  These tear-down races are disambiguated by the error return
+    values of <function>utrace_set_events</function> and
+    <function>utrace_control</function>.  Normally
+    <function>utrace_control</function> called with
+    <constant>UTRACE_DETACH</constant> returns zero, and this means that no
+    more callbacks will be made.  If the thread is in the midst of dying,
+    it returns <constant>-EALREADY</constant> to indicate that the
+    <constant>report_death</constant> callback may already be in progress;
+    when you get this error, you know that any cleanup your
+    <function>report_death</function> callback does is about to happen or
+    has just happened--note that if the <function>report_death</function>
+    callback does not detach, the engine remains attached until the thread
+    gets reaped.  If the thread is in the midst of being reaped,
+    <function>utrace_control</function> returns <constant>-ESRCH</constant>
+    to indicate that the <function>report_reap</function> callback may
+    already be in progress; this means the engine is implicitly detached
+    when the callback completes.  This makes it possible for a tracing
+    engine that has decided asynchronously to detach from a thread to
+    safely clean up its data structures, knowing that no
+    <function>report_death</function> or <function>report_reap</function>
+    callback will try to do the same.  <constant>utrace_detach</constant>
+    returns <constant>-ESRCH</constant> when the <structname>struct
+    utrace_attached_engine</structname> has already been detached, but is
+    still a valid pointer because of its reference count.  A tracing engine
+    can use this to safely synchronize its own independent multiple threads
+    of control with each other and with its event callbacks that detach.
+  </para>
+
+  <para>
+    In the same vein, <function>utrace_set_events</function> normally
+    returns zero; if the target thread was stopped before the call, then
+    after a successful call, no event callbacks not requested in the new
+    flags will be made.  It fails with <constant>-EALREADY</constant> if
+    you try to clear <constant>UTRACE_EVENT(DEATH)</constant> when the
+    <function>report_death</function> callback may already have begun, if
+    you try to clear <constant>UTRACE_EVENT(REAP)</constant> when the
+    <function>report_reap</function> callback may already have begun, or if
+    you try to newly set <constant>UTRACE_EVENT(DEATH)</constant> or
+    <constant>UTRACE_EVENT(QUIESCE)</constant> when the target is already
+    dead or dying.  Like <function>utrace_control</function>, it returns
+    <constant>-ESRCH</constant> when the thread has already been detached
+    (including forcible detach on reaping).  This lets the tracing engine
+    know for sure which event callbacks it will or won't see after
+    <function>utrace_set_events</function> has returned.  By checking for
+    errors, it can know whether to clean up its data structures immediately
+    or to let its callbacks do the work.
+  </para>
+  </sect2>
+
+  <sect2 id="barrier"><title>Using <function>utrace_barrier</function></title>
+  <para>
+    When a thread is safely stopped, calling
+    <function>utrace_control</function> with <constant>UTRACE_DETACH</constant>
+    or calling <function>utrace_set_events</function> to disable some events
+    ensures synchronously that your engine won't get any more of the callbacks
+    that have been disabled (none at all when detaching).  But these can also
+    be used while the thread is not stopped, when it might be simultaneously
+    making a callback to your engine.  For this situation, these calls return
+    <constant>-EINPROGRESS</constant> when it's possible a callback is in
+    progress.  If you are not prepared to have your old callbacks still run,
+    then you can synchronize to be sure all the old callbacks are finished,
+    using <function>utrace_barrier</function>.  This is necessary if the
+    kernel module containing your callback code is going to be unloaded.
+  </para>
+  <para>
+    After using <constant>UTRACE_DETACH</constant> once, further calls to
+    <function>utrace_control</function> with the same engine pointer will
+    return <constant>-ESRCH</constant>.  In contrast, after getting
+    <constant>-EINPROGRESS</constant> from
+    <function>utrace_set_events</function>, you can call
+    <function>utrace_set_events</function> again later and if it returns zero
+    then know the old callbacks have finished.
+  </para>
+  <para>
+    Unlike all other calls, <function>utrace_barrier</function> (and
+    <function>utrace_barrier_pid</function>) will accept any engine pointer you
+    hold a reference on, even if <constant>UTRACE_DETACH</constant> has already
+    been used.  After any <function>utrace_control</function> or
+    <function>utrace_set_events</function> call (these do not block), you can
+    call <function>utrace_barrier</function> to block until callbacks have
+    finished.  This returns <constant>-ESRCH</constant> only if the engine is
+    completely detached (finished all callbacks).  Otherwise returns it waits
+    until the thread is definitely not in the midst of a callback to this
+    engine and then returns zero, but can return
+    <constant>-ERESTARTSYS</constant> if its wait is interrupted.

+/**
+ * struct utrace_engine_ops - tracing engine callbacks
+ *
+ * Each @report_*() callback corresponds to an %UTRACE_EVENT(*) bit.
+ * utrace_set_events() calls on @engine choose which callbacks will be made
+ * to @engine from @task.
+ *
+ * Most callbacks take an @action argument, giving the resume action
+ * chosen by other tracing engines.  All callbacks take an @engine
+ * argument, and a @task argument, which is always equal to @current.
+ * For some calls, @action also includes bits specific to that event
+ * and utrace_resume_action() is used to extract the resume action.
+ * This shows what would happen if @engine wasn't there, or will if
+ * the callback's return value uses %UTRACE_RESUME.  This always
+ * starts as %UTRACE_RESUME when no other tracing is being done on
+ * this task.
+ *
+ * All return values contain &enum utrace_resume_action bits.  For
+ * some calls, other bits specific to that kind of event are added to
+ * the resume action bits with OR.  These are the same bits used in
+ * the @action argument.  The resume action returned by a callback
+ * does not override previous engines' choices, it only says what
+ * @engine wants done.  What @task actually does is the action that's
+ * most constrained among the choices made by all attached engines.
+ * See utrace_control() for more information on the actions.
+ *
+ * When %UTRACE_STOP is used in @report_syscall_entry, then @task
+ * stops before attempting the system call.  In other cases, the
+ * resume action does not take effect until @task is ready to check
+ * for signals and return to user mode.  If there are more callbacks
+ * to be made, the last round of calls determines the final action.
+ * A @report_quiesce callback with @event zero, or a @report_signal
+ * callback, will always be the last one made before @task resumes.
+ * Only %UTRACE_STOP is "sticky"--if @engine returned %UTRACE_STOP
+ * then @task stays stopped unless @engine returns different from a
+ * following callback.
+ *
+ * The report_death() and report_reap() callbacks do not take @action
+ * arguments, and only %UTRACE_DETACH is meaningful in the return value
+ * from a report_death() callback.  None of the resume actions applies
+ * to a dead thread.
+ *
+ * All @report_*() hooks are called with no locks held, in a generally
+ * safe environment when we will be returning to user mode soon (or just
+ * entered the kernel).  It is fine to block for memory allocation and
+ * the like, but all hooks are asynchronous and must not block on
+ * external events!  If you want the thread to block, use %UTRACE_STOP
+ * in your hook's return value; then later wake it up with utrace_control().
+ *
+ * The @unsafe_exec and @tracer_task hooks are not associated with
+ * event reports.  These may be %NULL if the engine has nothing to say.
+ * These hooks are called in more constrained environments and should
+ * not block or do very much.
+ *
+ * @report_quiesce:
+ *	Requested by %UTRACE_EVENT(%QUIESCE).
+ *	This does not indicate any event, but just that @task (the current
+ *	thread) is in a safe place for examination.  This call is made
+ *	before each specific event callback, except for @report_reap.
+ *	The @event argument gives the %UTRACE_EVENT(@which) value for
+ *	the event occurring.  This callback might be made for events @engine
+ *	has not requested, if some other engine is tracing the event;
+ *	calling utrace_set_events() call here can request the immediate
+ *	callback for this occurrence of @event.  @event is zero when there
+ *	is no other event, @task is now ready to check for signals and
+ *	return to user mode, and some engine has used %UTRACE_REPORT or
+ *	%UTRACE_INTERRUPT to request this callback.  For this case,
+ *	if @report_signal is not %NULL, the @report_quiesce callback
+ *	may be replaced with a @report_signal callback passing
+ *	%UTRACE_SIGNAL_REPORT in its @action argument, whenever @task is
+ *	entering the signal-check path anyway.
+ *
+ * @report_signal:
+ *	Requested by %UTRACE_EVENT(%SIGNAL_*) or %UTRACE_EVENT(%QUIESCE).
+ *	Use utrace_signal_action() and utrace_resume_action() on @action.
+ *	The signal action is %UTRACE_SIGNAL_REPORT when some engine has
+ *	used %UTRACE_REPORT or %UTRACE_INTERRUPT; the callback can choose
+ *	to stop or to deliver an artificial signal, before pending signals.
+ *	It's %UTRACE_SIGNAL_HANDLER instead when signal handler setup just
+ *	finished (after a previous %UTRACE_SIGNAL_DELIVER return); this
+ *	serves in lieu of any %UTRACE_SIGNAL_REPORT callback requested by
+ *	%UTRACE_REPORT or %UTRACE_INTERRUPT, and is also implicitly
+ *	requested by %UTRACE_SINGLESTEP or %UTRACE_BLOCKSTEP into the
+ *	signal delivery.  The other signal actions indicate a signal about
+ *	to be delivered; the previous engine's return value sets the signal
+ *	action seen by the the following engine's callback.  The @info data
+ *	can be changed at will, including @info->si_signo.  The settings in
+ *	@return_ka determines what %UTRACE_SIGNAL_DELIVER does.  @orig_ka
+ *	is what was in force before other tracing engines intervened, and
+ *	it's %NULL when this report began as %UTRACE_SIGNAL_REPORT or
+ *	%UTRACE_SIGNAL_HANDLER.  For a report without a new signal, @info
+ *	is left uninitialized and must be set completely by an engine that
+ *	chooses to deliver a signal; if there was a previous @report_signal
+ *	callback ending in %UTRACE_STOP and it was just resumed using
+ *	%UTRACE_REPORT or %UTRACE_INTERRUPT, then @info is left unchanged
+ *	from the previous callback.  In this way, the original signal can
+ *	be left in @info while returning %UTRACE_STOP|%UTRACE_SIGNAL_IGN
+ *	and then found again when resuming @task with %UTRACE_INTERRUPT.
+ *	The %UTRACE_SIGNAL_HOLD flag bit can be OR'd into the return value,
+ *	and might be in @action if the previous engine returned it.  This
+ *	flag asks that the signal in @info be pushed back on @task's queue
+ *	so that it will be seen again after whatever action is taken now.
+ *
+ * @report_clone:
+ *	Requested by %UTRACE_EVENT(%CLONE).
+ *	Event reported for parent, before the new task @child might run.
+ *	@clone_flags gives the flags used in the clone system call,
+ *	or equivalent flags for a fork() or vfork() system call.
+ *	This function can use utrace_attach_task() on @child.  It's guaranteed
+ *	that asynchronous utrace_attach_task() calls will be ordered after
+ *	any calls in @report_clone callbacks for the parent.  Thus
+ *	when using %UTRACE_ATTACH_EXCLUSIVE in the asynchronous calls,
+ *	you can be sure that the parent's @report_clone callback has
+ *	already attached to @child or chosen not to.  Passing %UTRACE_STOP
+ *	to utrace_control() on @child here keeps the child stopped before
+ *	it ever runs in user mode, %UTRACE_REPORT or %UTRACE_INTERRUPT
+ *	ensures a callback from @child before it starts in user mode.
+ *
+ * @report_jctl:
+ *	Requested by %UTRACE_EVENT(%JCTL).
+ *	Job control event; @type is %CLD_STOPPED or %CLD_CONTINUED,
+ *	indicating whether we are stopping or resuming now.  If @notify
+ *	is nonzero, @task is the last thread to stop and so will send
+ *	%SIGCHLD to its parent after this callback; @notify reflects
+ *	what the parent's %SIGCHLD has in @si_code, which can sometimes
+ *	be %CLD_STOPPED even when @type is %CLD_CONTINUED.
+ *
+ * @report_exec:
+ *	Requested by %UTRACE_EVENT(%EXEC).
+ *	An execve system call has succeeded and the new program is about to
+ *	start running.  The initial user register state is handy to be tweaked
+ *	directly in @regs.  @fmt and @bprm gives the details of this exec.
+ *
+ * @report_syscall_entry:
+ *	Requested by %UTRACE_EVENT(%SYSCALL_ENTRY).
+ *	Thread has entered the kernel to request a system call.
+ *	The user register state is handy to be tweaked directly in @regs.
+ *	The @action argument contains an &enum utrace_syscall_action,
+ *	use utrace_syscall_action() to extract it.  The return value
+ *	overrides the last engine's action for the system call.
+ *	If the final action is %UTRACE_SYSCALL_ABORT, no system call
+ *	is made.  The details of the system call being attempted can
+ *	be fetched here with syscall_get_nr() and syscall_get_arguments().
+ *	The parameter registers can be changed with syscall_set_arguments().
+ *
+ * @report_syscall_exit:
+ *	Requested by %UTRACE_EVENT(%SYSCALL_EXIT).
+ *	Thread is about to leave the kernel after a system call request.
+ *	The user register state is handy to be tweaked directly in @regs.
+ *	The results of the system call attempt can be examined here using
+ *	syscall_get_error() and syscall_get_return_value().  It is safe
+ *	here to call syscall_set_return_value() or syscall_rollback().
+ *
+ * @report_exit:
+ *	Requested by %UTRACE_EVENT(%EXIT).
+ *	Thread is exiting and cannot be prevented from doing so,
+ *	but all its state is still live.  The @code value will be
+ *	the wait result seen by the parent, and can be changed by
+ *	this engine or others.  The @orig_code value is the real
+ *	status, not changed by any tracing engine.  Returning %UTRACE_STOP
+ *	here keeps @task stopped before it cleans up its state and dies,
+ *	so it can be examined by other processes.  When @task is allowed
+ *	to run, it will die and get to the @report_death callback.
+ *
+ * @report_death:
+ *	Requested by %UTRACE_EVENT(%DEATH).
+ *	Thread is really dead now.  It might be reaped by its parent at
+ *	any time, or self-reap immediately.  Though the actual reaping
+ *	may happen in parallel, a report_reap() callback will always be
+ *	ordered after a report_death() callback.
+ *
+ * @report_reap:
+ *	Requested by %UTRACE_EVENT(%REAP).
+ *	Called when someone reaps the dead task (parent, init, or self).
+ *	This means the parent called wait, or else this was a detached
+ *	thread or a process whose parent ignores SIGCHLD.
+ *	No more callbacks are made after this one.
+ *	The engine is always detached.
+ *	There is nothing more a tracing engine can do about this thread.
+ *	After this callback, the @engine pointer will become invalid.
+ *	The @task pointer may become invalid if get_task_struct() hasn't
+ *	been used to keep it alive.
+ *	An engine should always request this callback if it stores the
+ *	@engine pointer or stores any pointer in @engine->data, so it
+ *	can clean up its data structures.
+ *	Unlike other callbacks, this can be called from the parent's context
+ *	rather than from the traced thread itself--it must not delay the
+ *	parent by blocking.
+ *
+ * @unsafe_exec:
+ *	Used if not %NULL.
+ *	Return %LSM_UNSAFE_* bits that apply to the exec in progress
+ *	due to tracing done by this engine.  These bits indicate that
+ *	someone is able to examine the process and so a set-UID or similar
+ *	privilege escalation may not be safe to permit.
+ *	Called with task_lock() held.
+ *
+ * @tracer_task:
+ *	Used if not %NULL.
+ *	Return the &struct task_struct for the task using ptrace() on
+ *	@task, or %NULL.  Always called with rcu_read_lock() held to
+ *	keep the returned struct alive.  At exec time, this may be
+ *	called with task_lock() still held from when unsafe_exec() was
+ *	just called.  In that case it must give results consistent
+ *	with those unsafe_exec() results, i.e. non-%NULL if any
+ *	%LSM_UNSAFE_PTRACE_* bits were set.  The value is also used to
+ *	display after "TracerPid:" in /proc/PID/status, where it is
+ *	called with only rcu_read_lock() held.  If this engine returns
+ *	%NULL, another engine may supply the result.

+ * utrace_control - control a thread being traced by a tracing engine
+ * @target:		thread to affect
+ * @engine:		attached engine to affect
+ * @action:		&enum utrace_resume_action for thread to do
+ *
+ * This is how a tracing engine asks a traced thread to do something.
+ * This call is controlled by the @action argument, which has the
+ * same meaning as the &enum utrace_resume_action value returned by
+ * event reporting callbacks.
+ *
+ * If @target is already dead (@target->exit_state nonzero),
+ * all actions except %UTRACE_DETACH fail with -%ESRCH.
+ *
+ * The following sections describe each option for the @action argument.
+ *
+ * UTRACE_DETACH:
+ *
+ * After this, the @engine data structure is no longer accessible,
+ * and the thread might be reaped.  The thread will start running
+ * again if it was stopped and no longer has any attached engines
+ * that want it stopped.
+ *
+ * If the @report_reap callback may already have begun, this fails
+ * with -%ESRCH.  If the @report_death callback may already have
+ * begun, this fails with -%EALREADY.
+ *
+ * If @target is not already stopped, then a callback to this engine
+ * might be in progress or about to start on another CPU.  If so,
+ * then this returns -%EINPROGRESS; the detach happens as soon as
+ * the pending callback is finished.  To synchronize after an
+ * -%EINPROGRESS return, see utrace_barrier().
+ *
+ * If @target is properly stopped before utrace_control() is called,
+ * then after successful return it's guaranteed that no more callbacks
+ * to the @engine->ops vector will be made.
+ *
+ * The only exception is %SIGKILL (and exec or group-exit by another
+ * thread in the group), which can cause asynchronous @report_death
+ * and/or @report_reap callbacks even when %UTRACE_STOP was used.
+ * (In that event, this fails with -%ESRCH or -%EALREADY, see above.)
+ *
+ * UTRACE_STOP:
+ * This asks that @target stop running.  This returns 0 only if
+ * @target is already stopped, either for tracing or for job
+ * control.  Then @target will remain stopped until another
+ * utrace_control() call is made on @engine; @target can be woken
+ * only by %SIGKILL (or equivalent, such as exec or termination by
+ * another thread in the same thread group).
+ *
+ * This returns -%EINPROGRESS if @target is not already stopped.
+ * Then the effect is like %UTRACE_REPORT.  A @report_quiesce or
+ * @report_signal callback will be made soon.  Your callback can
+ * then return %UTRACE_STOP to keep @target stopped.
+ *
+ * This does not interrupt system calls in progress, including ones
+ * that sleep for a long time.  For that, use %UTRACE_INTERRUPT.
+ * To interrupt system calls and then keep @target stopped, your
+ * @report_signal callback can return %UTRACE_STOP.
+ *
+ * UTRACE_RESUME:
+ *
+ * Just let @target continue running normally, reversing the effect
+ * of a previous %UTRACE_STOP.  If another engine is keeping @target
+ * stopped, then it remains stopped until all engines let it resume.
+ * If @target was not stopped, this has no effect.
+ *
+ * UTRACE_REPORT:
+ *
+ * This is like %UTRACE_RESUME, but also ensures that there will be
+ * a @report_quiesce or @report_signal callback made soon.  If
+ * @target had been stopped, then there will be a callback before it
+ * resumes running normally.  If another engine is keeping @target
+ * stopped, then there might be no callbacks until all engines let
+ * it resume.
+ *
+ * UTRACE_INTERRUPT:
+ *
+ * This is like %UTRACE_REPORT, but ensures that @target will make a
+ * @report_signal callback before it resumes or delivers signals.
+ * If @target was in a system call or about to enter one, work in
+ * progress will be interrupted as if by %SIGSTOP.  If another
+ * engine is keeping @target stopped, then there might be no
+ * callbacks until all engines let it resume.
+ *
+ * This gives @engine an opportunity to introduce a forced signal
+ * disposition via its @report_signal callback.
+ *
+ * UTRACE_SINGLESTEP:
+ *
+ * It's invalid to use this unless arch_has_single_step() returned true.
+ * This is like %UTRACE_RESUME, but resumes for one user instruction
+ * only.  It's invalid to use this in utrace_control() unless @target
+ * had been stopped by @engine previously.
+ *
+ * Note that passing %UTRACE_SINGLESTEP or %UTRACE_BLOCKSTEP to
+ * utrace_control() or returning it from an event callback alone does
+ * not necessarily ensure that stepping will be enabled.  If there are
+ * more callbacks made to any engine before returning to user mode,
+ * then the resume action is chosen only by the last set of callbacks.
+ * To be sure, enable %UTRACE_EVENT(%QUIESCE) and look for the
+ * @report_quiesce callback with a zero event mask, or the
+ * @report_signal callback with %UTRACE_SIGNAL_REPORT.
+ *
+ * UTRACE_BLOCKSTEP:
+ *
+ * It's invalid to use this unless arch_has_block_step() returned true.
+ * This is like %UTRACE_SINGLESTEP, but resumes for one whole basic
+ * block of user instructions.
+ *
+ * %UTRACE_BLOCKSTEP devolves to %UTRACE_SINGLESTEP when another
+ * tracing engine is using %UTRACE_SINGLESTEP at the same time.
