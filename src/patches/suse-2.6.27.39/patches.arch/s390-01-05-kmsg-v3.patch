Subject: Kernel message catalog infrastucture and message generation
References: bnc#417300

Instrument the kernel components such that a kernel message catalog as well as
related man pages can be automatically generated.

This patch now uses pr_xyz instead of kmsg_xyz and there is no Tag anymore
inside the doc file.
