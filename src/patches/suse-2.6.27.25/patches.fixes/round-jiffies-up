Subject: Add round_jiffies_up and related routines
From: Alan Stern <stern@rowland.harvard.edu>

References: bnc#464155

This patch (as1158b) adds round_jiffies_up() and friends.  These
routines work like the analogous round_jiffies() functions, except
that they will never round down.

The new routines will be useful for timeouts where we don't care
exactly when the timer expires, provided it doesn't expire too soon.
