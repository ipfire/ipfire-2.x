Subject: [PATCH] ext3: always mark super uptodate before dirty
References: bnc#457043

 The superblock's bh is something of an exception. It is only read
 during mount and is only released during unmount. The in-memory
 copy is invariably the most recent one.

 If a write error occurs while syncing the superblock, it will be marked
 !uptodate. When another error occurs, ext3_error will invoke
 ext3_commit_super, which will mark the superblock dirty and try to
 sync it out again. If the buffer is !uptodate, then mark_buffer_dirty
 will issue a warning, but continue anyway.

 This patch marks it uptodate before writing it out. This doesn't really
 change anything other than silencing the warning in mark_buffer_dirty.
 If the write succeeds, good. Otherwise, it will just have uptodate
 cleared again.
