Subject: Provide possibility for vendors to fix BIOS issues for SLE11 only
References: none
Patch-Mainline: never

These BIOS issues generally should be solved in the mainine kernel.
But such ACPI interpreter fixes often are very intrusive and impossible to
add as a maintenance update.
This interface should only be used by vendors in emergency case, e.g.
for important pre-loads. Use cases could be:
  - BIOS cannot generally be fixed because it's already validated against
    Windows OSes, with this patch a SLE11 specific BIOS fix can be added
  - Kernel cannot be fixed, because the fix would be too intrusive
In most cases both above scenarios would be valid.
