Subject: revert - SCSI: qla2xxx: Return a FAILED status when abort mailbox-command fails.

-------------------
This is a revert of this patch that is included in 2.6.27.7
as a further qla2xxx driver update in the series conflicts with this
  - gregkh

From: Michael Reed <mdr@sgi.com>

commit 5bff55db3dc4d659f46b4d2fce2f61c1964c2762 upstream.

Mike Reed noted
(https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=421330) that the
driver was incorrectly returning a SUCCESS status if the driver's
request to the firmware to abort a command failed.  By doing so,
the mid-layer believed, incorrectly, that the command has
completed and has been returned (ultimately clearing
scsi_cmnd.request_buffer) yet the driver still has the command.
What should correctly happen is a mid-layer escalation
(device-reset, etc.) of recovery during which the driver will
eventually return the outstanding commands to the mid-layer.
