Subject: [PATCH] LSM: Export security_inode_permission for aufs
Patch-mainline: Never
References: 356902

 In order for aufs to work with AppArmor, it needs to be able to call
 security_inode_permission itself.

 This patch is a _workaround_ since the author will need to find a
 mainline-compatible solution moving forward.
