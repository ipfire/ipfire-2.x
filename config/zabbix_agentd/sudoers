# This is needed for some IPFire specific userparameters to be able to execute commands that only run as root (using sudo)
#
# DO NOT CHANGE THIS FILE. This file is managed by IPFire, will be overwritten on next addon upgrade and is not
#                          included in the backup.
#
# To add more sudo rights to zabbix agent, you should modify the sudoers file zabbix_agentd_user
