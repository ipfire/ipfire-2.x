How to install Ipfire as a Xen DomU:

- run xen-image-maker.sh to download and build the xen-images.
  you need to be root because the skript do some loop mounts.
  The script need wget and gpg for download and decode ipfire packages.

- edit the file ipfire.cfg
- start ipfire:  "xm create ipfire.cfg"
- if you get no errormessage go to console: "xm console ipfire-xen"
- after booting, the setup will started to do basic settings and reboot
  (Ignore the errormessages. The services are not startet yet)

This setup is for 2 interfaces (green and red).
If you want more, like orange and blue, edit the ipfire.cfg and execute
"setup" to adjust yout config.

other usefull commands from the Dom0:
- shutdown the fire: "xm shutdown ipfire-xen"
- reset the fire: "xm destroy ipfire-xen"
- look what is going on: "xm top" or "xm list"

This script can also build a Citrix XenCenter xva image. (Need xz-aware
xen version. Tested with Citrix Xen Server 6.2.5 beta)
- run "XEN_IMG_TYPE=xva sh xen-image-maker.sh" to build an xva image.
- import the vm with "xe vm-import file=ipfire.xfa"
