# The machines IP address that is visable to the internet
# If this is left undefined, then guardian will attempt to get the information
# from ifconfig, as long as it has an interface to use. This would be useful
# for people on ppp links, or dhcp machines, or if you are lazy :)
# HostIpAddr       

# Here we define the interface which we will use to guess the IP address, and
# block incoming offending packets. This is the only option that is required
# for guardian to run. If the rest are undefined, guardian will use the default.
Interface       ppp0

# The last octet of the ip address, which gives us the gateway address.

# This is a list of IP addresses on the current host, in case there is more

# with the default setup (machine's ip address, and broadcast/network).

# The time in seconds to keep a host blocked. If undefined, it defaults to 
# 99999999, which basicly disables the feature.
