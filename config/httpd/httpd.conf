### Global Environment ######################################################
#
# The directives in this section affect the overall operation of Apache,
# such as the number of concurrent requests.

# run under this user/group id
Include /etc/httpd/conf/uid.conf

# - how many server processes to start (server pool regulation)
# - usage of KeepAlive
Include /etc/httpd/conf/server-tuning.conf

# ErrorLog: The location of the error log file.
# If you do not specify an ErrorLog directive within a <VirtualHost>
# container, error messages relating to that virtual host will be
# logged here.  If you *do* define an error logfile for a <VirtualHost>
# container, that host's errors will be logged there and not here.
ErrorLog /var/log/httpd/error_log

# Load Modules here
Include /etc/httpd/conf/loadmodule.conf

# IP addresses / ports to listen on
Include /etc/httpd/conf/listen.conf

# predefined logging formats
Include /etc/httpd/conf/mod_log_config.conf

# global settings
Include /etc/httpd/conf/global.conf

# optional mod_status, mod_info
#Include /etc/httpd/conf/mod_status.conf
#Include /etc/httpd/conf/mod_info.conf

# associate MIME types with filename extensions
TypesConfig /etc/mime.types

# global (server-wide) SSL configuration, that is not specific to 
# any virtual host
Include /etc/httpd/conf/ssl-global.conf

<Directory />
    Options None
    AllowOverride None
</Directory>

# use .htaccess files for overriding,
AccessFileName .htaccess
# and never show them
<Files ~ "^\.ht">
    Require all denied
</Files>

# List of resources to look for when the client requests a directory
DirectoryIndex index.html index.htm index.shtml index.cgi

### 'Main' server configuration #############################################
#
# The directives in this section set up the values used by the 'main'
# server, which responds to any requests that aren't handled by a
# <VirtualHost> definition.  These values also provide defaults for
# any <VirtualHost> containers you may define later in the file.
#
# All of these directives may appear inside <VirtualHost> containers,
# in which case these default settings will be overridden for the
# virtual host being defined.
#
Include /etc/httpd/conf/default-server.conf


### Virtual server configuration ############################################
#
# VirtualHost: If you want to maintain multiple domains/hostnames on your
# machine you can setup VirtualHost containers for them. Most configurations
# use only name-based virtual hosts so the server doesn't need to worry about
# IP addresses. This is indicated by the asterisks in the directives below.
#
# Please see the documentation at
# <URL:http://httpd.apache.org/docs-2.0/vhosts/>
# for further details before you try to setup virtual hosts.
#
# You may use the command line option '-S' to verify your virtual host
# configuration.
#
Include /etc/httpd/conf/vhosts.d/*.conf

# Dummy LoadModule directive to aid module installations
#LoadModule dummy_module /usr/lib/apache2/modules/mod_dummy.so
